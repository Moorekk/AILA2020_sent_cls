1,"This appeal, by special leave, by the appellant State is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Assam and Nagaland, dated March 4, 1968 in Civil Rule no. 206 of 1967 (reported in 1969 AIR(Assam) 3 ) by which the High Court quashed an order passed by the Deputy Director of Education, Nagaland, dated February 10, 1967 terminating the services of the respondent as an Assistant Teacher with effect from April 1, 1967.",1
1,"The respondent was appointed by an order of the Chief Secretary of Nagaland, dated October 23, 1962 as an Assistant Teacher and she was posted in Zunheboto Government High School.",6
1,The category of the post to which she was appointed was Class III (Non Gazetted).,6
1,"By an order dated February 16, 1967 of the Deputy Director of Education, Nagaland, the services of the respondent as Assistant Teacher were terminated with effect from April 1, 1967.",6
1,"The respondent filed Civil Rule no. 206 of 1967 in the High Court of Assam and Nagaland for quashing the order dated February 16, 1967 terminating her services.",6
1,According to her she had served as a teacher for a period of five years and she was fairly high in the Seniority List and that her work has been completely free from any blemish.,6
1,"While so, without giving any reason her services had been terminated arbitrarily and illegally.",6
1,"She also pleaded that by virtue of the order dated November 10, 1966 of the State Government, her services as well as the post which she held had both been made permanent.",6
1,"It was her further case that she had been appointed by the Chief Secretary of the Government, while the order of termination was by a subordinate officer, viz., the Deputy Director of Education.",6
1,On these grounds the respondent pleaded that the order terminating her services was illegal and opposed to the principles of natural justice and there had been a breach of the provision of Article 311.,2
1,"The State of Nagaland, the appellant, controverted the claim of the respondent that her services had been made permanent and that there had been a violation of Article 311.",2
1,"On the other hand, the State pleaded that the respondent had been appointed on a purely temporary basis to a temporary post and, according to the terms and conditions governing the appointment, her services could be terminated by giving one month's notice.",2
1,The order of termination fully satisfies this requirement.,1
1,The State further pleaded that the services of the respondent had never been made permanent.,2
1,"The Deputy Director of Education, who was exercising the powers of the Head of the Department was fully competent to pass the order in question.",1
1,"In view of these circumstances, the State pleaded that Article 311 of the Constitution did not apply and that the order of termination was valid.",2
1,"Before the High Court the respondent raised two contentions both related to Article 311 and they were (1) that as the respondent had been appointed by the Chief Secretary to Government, the order of termination by a subordinate authority was in violation of Article 311 and therefore void; and (2) though initially she was appointed on a temporary basis, later on the post which she held as well as her services, had both been made permanent and therefore the order of termination, without complying with the requirements of Article 311, was void.",2
1,The High Court has substantially accepted both the above contentions.,3
1,It has taken the view that the Deputy Director of Education had no. jurisdiction to terminate the services of the respondent as her appointment was by the Chief Secretary to the Government.,3
1,"Even though there may have been a delegation of powers to the Deputy Director of Education, the High Court's view is that the said officer has no. authority to pass an order of termination as that will be depriving the respondent of her rights under Article 311.",3
1,"The High Court, relying upon the Circular, dated November 10, 1966 of the Government, has further held that the services of the respondent had been made permanent and therefore the order terminating her services has the effect of removing her from service and placing the respondent in a position where she could no. longer serve the State.",3
1,"This, according to the High Court has further taken the view that though the termination of the respondent's services was innocuous and not on any disciplinary or punitive grounds, nevertheless, in view of the fact that she has been service for merely five years and no. reason is given by the State for terminating her services, it must be inferred that the order of termination must have been passed by way of punishment or penalty.",3
1,"On these grounds the High Court quashed the order, dated February 10, 1967.",3
1,"Mr. Naunit Lal, learned counsel for the appellant, pointed out that the High Court has committed a very serious error in holding that Article 311 has been violated when the order terminating the services of the respondent was passed.",2
1,The counsel further pointed out that the High Court has committed a mistake in proceeding on the basis that the respondent was a quasi permanent employee.,2
1,"It was also urged that the High Court, having come to the conclusion that the order of termination was not passed on any disciplinary or punitive grounds, erred in setting aside the order on the ground that the said order must have been passed by way of punishment or penalty because the respondent has been in service for nearly five years.",2
1,"The counsel finally urged that the respondent being a temporary servant, her services had been terminated under the contract of service and the State Government was entitled to pass such an order.",2
1,"Mr. Lakshmi Narasu, learned counsel appearing for the respondent, in view of the approach made by the High Court, found considerable difficulty in supporting the order.",2
1,"But the counsel urged that as the High Court has come to the conclusion that the order of termination must have been passed by way of punishment, and as the services of the respondent who had been in service for over five years had been terminated without giving any reason, this Court need not interfere with the decision of the High Court.",2
1,"In our opinion, the High Court has committed a fundamental error in proceeding on the basis that Article 311 applies to the respondent.",1
1,"The High Court has also committed another serious mistake in proceeding on the basis that the order dated November 10, 1966 of the State Government made the respondent a quasi permanent government servant.",1
1,"The order dated October 23, 1962 appointing the respondent as an Assistant Teacher clearly says that the post to which she is appointed is a temporary one and that her appointment itself is made on a purely temporary basis.",1
1,The order further states that the services of the respondent may be terminated by one calendar month's notice in writing on either side. no. doubt the respondent was in service till the impugned order was passed.,1
1,"Rules 2 (b), 3 and 4 of the Central Services (Temporary Services) Rules, 1949 read together show that a government servant shall be deemed to be in quasi permanent service if the said government servant has been in continuous government service for more than three years and the appointing authority is satisfied regarding the matters relating to the said employee referred to in Rule 3, and issues a declaration to that effect.",0
1,"The State Government, no. doubt appears to have taken a decision on August 17, 1966 to make certain temporary employees quasi permanent and accordingly certain posts also were made permanent.",1
1,"The Government also issued a Circular, dated October 10, 1966 making the temporary posts in the Schedules attached to that order into permanent posts under the Education Department.",1
1,"But it will be seen that except making those posts permanent, the services of the incumbents of such posts had not been made permanent, as wrongly assumed by the High Court.",1
1,"On the other hand, by order dated September 14, 1967 the State Government made various temporary employees permanent. no. such notification had been issued in respect of the respondent, i.e., no. declaration in respect of the respondent, as required under Rule 3 (2) of the Central Services (Temporary Services) Rules, 1949 has been issued.",1
1,Therefore the position was that the respondent continued to be a temporary servant on the date when the order under attack was passed.,1
1,"The High Court itself has stated. ""It is true that the termination appears to be innocuous and not on any disciplinary or punitive grounds"" .",1
1,"After this finding and in view of the fact that the respondent was only a temporary government servant, whose services had been terminated under the contract of service, no. further question regarding the validity of the order arises at all.",1
1,"But the High Court has expressed the opinion that Article 311 has been violated because it must be inferred that the order has been passed by way of punishment, especially when the respondent has been in service for over five years.",1
1,"This reasoning, in our opinion, is erroneous.",1
1,In fact the High Court has recorded two inconsistent findings : (i) that the termination is incases and not on any disciplinary or punishment grounds; and (ii) that the order of termination must be considered to have been passed by way of punishment.,1
1,"Even the respondent, so far as we could see, has not taken up any plea tot he effect that the order terminating her services was by way of punishment.",1
1,"no. doubt the High Court has referred to certain passages in the decision of this Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra vs Union of India, 1958 SCR 828 = 1958 AIR(SC) 36) 1957 Indlaw SC 103but those principles have no. application to the facts of the present case.",5
1,"Reviewing the case law on the subject, the recent decision of this Court in State of Punjab vs Sukh Raj, 1968 AIR(SC) 1089 1968 Indlaw SC 392 has laid down several propositions of which proposition no. 1 is as follows :",5
1,"""On a conspectus of these cases, the following propositions are clear :",1
1,"The services of a temporary servant or a probationer can be terminated under the rules of his employment and such termination without anything more would not attract the operation of Article 311 of the Constitution.""",1
1,"As we have already pointed out, the services of the respondent have been terminated according to the terms of the contract of service and the order terminating the service is one simpliciter and not by way of punishment.",1
1,"If so, the matter comes squarely within the proposition no. 1 set out above and it follows that Article 311 has no. application at all.",1
1,"As we have mentioned earlier, the respondent has raised a contention that as she was appointed by the Chief Secretary, the order terminating her services passed by the Deputy Director of Education, a subordinate authority, is not valid.",2
1,"But that contention, again was on the basis that Article 311 has been violated in this regard.",1
1,The appellant State has taken the stand that the power of appointment had been subsequently vested in the Director of Education and that there has been a delegation in favour of the Deputy Director of Education to exercise all the powers of the Director in this regard.,1
1,"In the view that we take that Article 311 has no. application to the case of the respondent, it becomes unnecessary to consider this aspect.",1
1,"In the result the order of the High Court, dated March 4, 1968 is set aside and this appeal allowed.",4
1,"In the circumstances of the case, there will be no. order as to costs.",4
1,Appeal allowed,4
2,"In this appeal, by special leave, the appellant challenges his conviction and sentence imposed upon him for offences under Sections 302, 201, read with Ss. 34 and 394, IPC For the offence of murder section 302 he has been sentenced to death and for the offences sections 201 and 394 he has been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 7 years and 10 years respectively and the sentences have been directed to run concurrently.",1
2,"The appellant's conviction for all these offences have been confirmed by the High Court of Allahabad, by its judgment dated November 13, 1967.",3
2,"The prosecution case, in brief, was as follows.",6
2,"The appellant, who was well known to and was friendly with one Kalawati, an old woman of about 70 years of age, had called on her on the morning of September 19, 1966 and asked her to come to his Gher in the evening to take some maize which he had got ready for her.",6
2,"Kalawati went to the Gher of the appellant at about 4 p.m., the same day.",6
2,"The appellant, with the assistance of another person Kripal (since deceased) killed Kalawati by strangling her and removed from her body gold and silver ornaments which she was wearing.",6
2,The dead body which was first concealed in a heap of chaff in the Gher of the appellant was later on thrown into a well known as Chamaron Wala Kuan.,6
2,"The tenants living in the house of Kalawati, as well as some neighbors, noticed the disappearance of Kalawati the same night and made a search which was of no avail.",6
2,"Later in the night of September 19, 1966 the appellant is stated to have come to the house of Kalawati and given out that the latter had gone away to the village of Garhi along with Kripal and that he had been asked to sleeps in her house; but the tenants trued him away.",6
2,"The dead body of Kalawati was found floating in the well on the morning of September 20, 1966 and a report, Exhibit Ka 4, was lodged with the police by one Mahendra Dutt, P.W. 11, who was a near relation of the deceased.",6
2,"After inquest proceedings, the post mortem certificate is Exhibit Ka 1.",6
2,The opinion of the Doctor is that death of Kalawati is due to asphyxia as a result of strangulation.,6
2,"The Station Officer, Mowana Police Station, on receiving information from an informer suspected the appellant as the culprit and consequently arrested him on September 21, 1966.",6
2,"The appellant is stated to have taken the police officers as well as certain witnesses to his house and taken out from his locked box six gold bangles, for gold ear rings, a gold ear top and four silver lachchas.",6
2,"These articles were identified as the property of the deceased by P. Ws. 1, 2 and 10.",6
2,The defence of the accused was one of complete denial and he also disputed the truth of any ornaments having been produced by him from his locked box after his arrest.,6
2,He further pleaded that he had been falsely implicated in the case because of the hostility of police as he has refused to give evidence in a gambling case.,6
2,He also pleaded that he had been between whom and his father there had been bitter enmity in connection with certain election proceedings.,6
2,That Kalawati was the victim of murder is clear from the evidence of the Doctor P.W. 3.,6
2,He has spoke to the fact that the death of Kalawati was due to asphyxia brought about by strangulation.,6
2,"He has also mentioned in his post mortem certificate, Exhibit Ka 1, that there was a contusion 3 1/2""x 2 1/2"" extending from the right side of the neck near the collar bone on to the upper part of the chest, and the soft tissues of the neck had been ruptured both in front and at the sides of the neck, while the hyoid bone was fractured.",6
2,There were naught witnesses a such for the murder and for establishing the guilt of the appellant the prosecution relied entirely on circumstantial evidence.,6
2,The procession relied on the following circumstances as proving the cult of the accused :,6
2,"""(1) That the accused was well acquainted with Mst.",6
2,Kalawati and often used to visit her house.,6
2,(2) That in the morning of 19 9 1966 the accused came to Kalawati's house and asked her to come to his enclosure in the evening to fetch some maize.,6
2,(3) That at 4 p.m. on 19 9 1966 Kalawati went to the enclosure of the accused and was seen with him there.,6
2,(4) That at about 10 or 11 p.m. on 19 9 1966 the accused came to Kalawati's house and told the tenants living there that Kalawati had gone off to Garhi with Kripal and that she had sent him to sleep at the house to guard the premises.,6
2,"(5) That on 21 9 1966 gold and silver ornaments belonging to Kalawati, which she had been wearing when she went to the accused's enclosure two days earlier, were recovered from a locked box in the accused's house, the key of which was produced by the accused.""",6
2,"P.Ws. 1, 4, and 11 have given evidence regarding circumstance no. 1.",6
2,P.W. 1 has spoken regarding circumstance no. 2.,6
2,P. W. 8 has given evidence regarding circumstance no. 3.,6
2,"This witness has stated that he saw on the evening of September 19, 1966 Kalawati in the company of the appellant and his associate Kripal.",6
2,"It may be stated that this was the last occasion when Kalawati was seen alive by any of the witnesses, because, on the next morning her dead body was found in the well.",6
2,"Circumstance no. 4 is spoken to by P.W. 1, her husband P. W. 4 and P.W. 7.",6
2,"The last circumstance, viz., the recovery of the ornaments belonging to the deceased on September 21, 1966 is spoken to by the two police officers, P. Ws. 14 and 17, as well as by P.W 6 who was one of the Panch witnesses of recovery, under Exhibit Ka 2, on September 21, 1966.",6
2,"Both the learned Sessions Judge, as well as the High Court on appeal, have accepted as true the evidence of the witnesses, referred to above, and have further held that the five circumstances, relied on by the prosecution, have been fully established.",3
2,"Taking all the circumstances together in conjunction with the denial of the accused, the High Court, in agreement with the learned Sessions Judge, has become to the conclusion that it is the appellant who murdered Kalawati, robbed her of her ornaments and disposed of her body by throwing it into the well.",3
2,"Mr. Nuruddin Ahmed, learned for the appellant, has urged two contentions : (i) that the finding regarding recovery of ornaments at the instance of the appellant, recorded by the learned Session Judge and the High Court, is perverse and that no reasonable person can come to that conclusion, on the evidence on record and (ii) that even if the recovery of ornaments at the instance of the appellant, is accepted as true, it does not lead to the conclusion that it is the appellant who committed the murder.",2
2,We are satisfied that neither of these contentions can be accepted.,1
2,The conviction of the appellant in this case is based upon circumstantial evidence and the High Court and the Sessions Judge have accepted as true the evidence of the witnesses who speak to the various circumstances relied on by the prosecution.,1
2,"When there are concurrent findings on facts, this Court does not, normally, taken upon itself the task of again reviewing the evidence; but, in view of the aback that the finding regarding recovery of ornaments is perverse, we have ourselves gone through to he evidence bearing on that aspect, and we are satisfied, notwithstanding certain minor discrepancies, that the evidence relating to the same is true and has been rightly accepted by the learned Sessions Judge and High Court.",1
2,"The production of ornaments by the appellant, after his arrest, and which ornaments have been identified as belonging to the deceased, is a very strong circumstance in the chain of circumstances relied on by the prosecution.",1
2,"The evidence relating to recovery of ornaments is furnished by the two police officers, P. Ws. 14 and 17 and the Panch witness P.W. 6.",1
2,"According to this evidence, the appellant was arrested on September 21, 1966 by P.W. 14 and the appellant agreed to produce the ornaments of Kalawati which he had kept in his house.",1
2,"The appellant took the place officers, P.W. 6 and one Bishamber Dayal to his house and, after opening the locked box which was in a room upstairs, he produced six gold bangles, four gold ear rings, one gold ear top and four silver lachchas.",1
2,"These articles have been identified by P. Ws. 1, 2 and 10 as belonging to the deceased.",1
2,These witnesses have spoken to the fact that these ornaments were normally worn by Kalawati.,1
2,Minor discrepancies in the evidence of the witnesses regarding the recovery of the ornaments have been adverted to by the High Court.,1
2,"Quite rightly, in the opinion, the High Court has taken the view that these discrepancies do not cast any doubt regarding the truth of the ornaments having been produced by the appellant after his arrest.",1
2,Therefor we cannot accept the contention of Mr. Nuruddin Ahmed that the finding regarding the recovery of the ornaments at the instance of the appellant is perverse.,1
2,"On the other hand, we are satisfied that the said finding properly and legitimately followed from the acceptance of the evidence of the two police officers and P W. 6.",1
2,"No doubt, the mere recovery of the ornaments if it had stood by itself, without any other circumstance, may not lead to the one and only conclusion that it is the appellant who committed the murder.",1
2,"But the prosecution has relied on for other circumstances, referred to above, and those circumstances, taken along with the circumstance regarding the recovery of the ornaments in our opinion, lead to the conclusion that it was the appellant who has committed the murder of Kalawati.",1
2,The mode of evaluating circumstantial evidence has been stated by this Court in Hanumant vs the State of Madhya Pradesh and is as follows :,5
2,"""It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established, and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.",5
2,"Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.",5
2,"In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it just be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.""",5
2,This principle has been reiterated by this Court in several later decisions.,1
2,"Applying the above principles, it is clear from the findings of the two Courts, that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt of the appellant is to be drawn have been fully established, and the chain of evidence accepted by both the Courts is also complete and does not leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the appellant.",1
2,"Kalawati was last seen in the company of the appellant in his Gher on the evening of September 19, 1966 and the appellant has also deliberately attempted to mislead the tenants of Kalawati's house by stating that she had gone to the village of Garthi along with Kripal.",1
2,"After his arrest, the production, by the appellant, of the ornaments worn by Kalawati is a vary clinching circumstance, which, taken along with the other circumstances, proves the complicity of the appellant in the murder of Kalawati.",1
2,"To conclude, the appellant has been rightly convicted and sentenced for offences under Section 302, 201, read with Ss. 34 and 394, I.P.C. The appeal fails and is dismissed.",4
2,Appeal Dismissed.,4
3,"This appeal is brought by special leave from the award of the industrial tribunal, Bihar, dated 15 September, 1967.",6
3,"The appellant Tatanagar Foundry Company, Ltd., is incorporated in the State of West Bengal and owns two manufacturing establishments, one located at Belur in the State of West Bengal and the other in Jamshedpur in Bihar.",6
3,"The appellant carried on its business at Belur but has now closed its business at Jamshedpur with effect from 20 November, 1966.",6
3,"At the time of the closure the appellant employed 1, 360 workmen in its Jamshedpur establishment where it was producing cast iron pipes, specials and heavy grey iron castings including ingots, moulds, etc.",6
3,"On 20 September 1966, the appellant issued a notice in respect of its business at Jamshedpur that due to shortage of orders and other economic reasons, about 120 workmen are being retrenched and the Commissioner of Labour, Government of Bihar, Patna, was duly notified of the said retrenchment.",6
3,"On 22 September, 1966, the Labour Superintendent, Government of Bihar, Jamshedpur, held conciliation proceedings at which the appellant agreed to retain the services of fourteen of the retrenched workmen and the union agreed to the retrenchment of the remaining workmen.",6
3,"On or about 12 October, 1966, by a notice of the same date, the appellant desired to retrench about 400 workmen, but at the intervention of the Superintendent of Labour, the notice was temporarily withdrawn with a view to discuss the matter with the union.",6
3,Accordingly a meeting was fixed on 21 October 1966 between the appellant and the union at Jamshedpur but the said meeting could not take place.,6
3,"On 29 October, 1966, the appellant by a notice laid off nearly 600 workmen for want of supplies of good quality raw materials.",6
3,"In a letter dated 8 November 1966, the Superintendent of Labour, Jamshedpur, wrote that the general secretary of the union had put up a proposal for running the Jamshedpur establishment of the appellant on a co operative basis and requested Sri G. D. Agarwalla, director of the appellant, to place the matter before the board of directors of the appellant.",6
3,"At their meeting on 17 November, 1966, the board of directors considered the letter dated 8 November, 1966 of the Labour Superintendent and resolved that if the State Government should be desirous of running the Jamshedpur plant on a co operative basis Sri G. D. Agarwalla was authorized to conduct negotiations with the State Government of Bihar.",6
3,But no further communication was received from the Government of Bihar indicating its willingness or intention to run the Jamshedpur branch of the appellant.,6
3,"At its meeting on 17 November, 1966, the board of directors of the appellants considered the situation in the Jamshedpur plant and decided that it should be closed as early as possible and Sri Agarwalla was authorized to take necessary steps to effect the closure.",6
3,"Pursuant to the decision of the board of directors Sri Agarwalla issued a notice dated 19 November, 1966.",6
3,"By the said notice the workmen of the appellant were informed of its decision to close the business at Jamshedpur for good with effect from 21 November, 1966 for the reasons explained in the notice.",6
3,"All the workmen were also informed that their services were no longer required after 21 November, 1966 and the workers should consider themselves as discharged with effect from the said date.",6
3,"On 3 February 1967, the Government of Bihar referred the following dispute to the industrial tribunal, Bihar, for adjudication under section 10(1)(d) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947)",0
3,"""Whether the closure of the Tatanagar Foundry Company, Ltd., Jamshedpur, is justified ? If not, to what relief, and compensation the workmen are entitled?""",1
3,"By its award, dated 15 September, 1967, the industrial tribunal held that it was satisfied that the closure of the Jamshedpur business of the appellant was not a closure but a lookout in the disguise of a closure and directed the reinstatement of the workmen with full wages for the period they have been out of employment.",3
3,In support of this appeal it was argued in the first place that the industrial tribunal had no jurisdiction to go into the question whether the closure of the Jamshedpur business was justified or not for financial or other reasons.,2
3,"The contention was that the tribunal having found that the factory had in fact closed down, it had no jurisdiction to go into the question whether the closure could have been avoided.",2
3,"In our opinion, the argument is well founded and must be accepted as correct.",1
3,"The distinction between a lockout and a closure has been explained by the decision of this Court in Express Newspapers, Ltd., vs Their workers and staff and other 1962 Indlaw SC 28 ].",5
3,"It was pointed out in that case that in the case of a closure, the employer does not merely close down the place of business but he closes the business itself finally and irrevocably.",5
3,A lockout on the other hand indicates the closure of the place of business and not closure of the business itself.,5
3,In the present case the totality of facts and circumstances would lead to the conclusion that the undertaking at Jamshedpur was closed down completely and was a final and irrecoverable termination of the business itself.,1
3,But the tribunal has come to a finding that the closure of the business was not bona fide but the closure was done in order to victimize the workmen.,3
3,"As regards the financial position, the tribunal took the view that on the whole the financial condition of the company in 1966 has not worsened to such an extent as to reasonably constitute a good ground for closing the business altogether.",3
3,It might have been a ground for reorganizing the company or rationalizing it by retrenchment or otherwise but it could not be a ground for winding up the business altogether.,1
3,"In our opinion, the finding of the tribunal on this point is defective in law.",1
3,It is now established that in the case of a closure the employer does not merely close down the place of business but he closes the business finally and irrevocably.,1
3,The closure has to be genuine and bona fide in the sense that it should be a closure in fact and not a mere pretence of closure.,1
3,"Taking into account the entire set of circumstances and facts in the present case, we are of opinion that there has been in fact a closure of the Jamshedpur business and the finding of the tribunal that there was a lockout is defective in law and must be set aside.",4
3,The next question is whether workmen were entitled to compensation under S.25FFF of the Industrial Disputes Act which states :,1
3,"""(1) Where an undertaking is closed down for any reason whatsoever, every workman who has been in continuous service for not less than one year in that undertaking immediately before such closure shall, subject to the provisions of Sub sec. (2), be entitled to notice and compensation in accordance with the provisions of section 25F, as if the workman had been retrenched;",1
3,"Provided that where the undertaking is closed down on account of unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the employer, the compensation to be paid to the workman under Cl. (b) of section 25F shall not exceed his average pay for three months.",4
3,Explanation.,1
3,"An undertaking which is closed down by reason merely of financial difficulties (including financial losses) or accumulation of undisposed of stocks or the expiry of the period of the lease or the licence granted to it where the period of the lease or the licence expires on or after 1 April, 1967 shall not be deemed to have been closed down on account of unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the employer within the meaning of the proviso to this sub section.""",1
3,The tribunal has found that the appellant was not right in its contention that the closure was due to unavoidable circumstances beyond its control.,1
3,According to the appellant the main reasons for the closure are :,1
3,(1) financial condition of the appellant;,1
3,(2) non availability of orders for supply of goods; and,1
3,(3) non co operation from the workmen in standardization of the working force and for reduction of the high percentage of rejection.,1
3,The tribunal has gone into the oral and documentary evidence adduced by the parties and reached the conclusion that the closure of the business was not due to unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the appellant.,1
3,We see no reason for interfering with the finding of the tribunal on this aspect of the case.,1
3,"The result, therefore, is that the workmen are entitled to compensation under the main clause of S.25FFF of the Industrial Disputes Act,1947.",4
3,"We accordingly modify the award of the industrial tribunal dated 15 September, 1967 and allow the appeal to the extent indicated.",4
3,There will no order as to costs.,4
3,Appeal partly allowed.,4
4,"The question involved in this case is whether the High Court of Calcutta was right in returning the plaint presented by the appellant for presentation to the proper Court under Order 7 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Code').",1
4,"The appellant is the owner of Flat no. 2 (now known as 'F'), 7th Floor, Gem Building at 5/B, Russel Street, Calcut ta.",6
4,"The said premises had been leased out in favour of the respondent on a monthly rent of Rs, 1,400.",6
4,"The respondent committed default in the payment of rent from the month of June, 1984.",6
4,"The appellant, therefore, served a notice on the respondent under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and section 13(6) of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') determining the tenancy with the expiry of the month of January, 1985 and called upon him to deliver possession of the premises.",0
4,"Upon failure of the respondent to hand over the vacant possession of the premises on the expiry of January, 1985 the appellant filed a suit in Suit no. 755 of 1985 on the Original Side of the High Court of Calcutta for recovery of possession of the premises and for recovery of arrears of rent amounting to rs. 11,200 and of Rs.78,000 by way of mesne profits/damages, claiming mesne profits/damages at the rate of Rs.7,800 per month from 1st February, 1985 until 30th November, 1985.",6
4,"The appellant valued the suit for purposes of court fee and jurisdiction at rs. 1,06,000 which was arrived at as follows:",6
4,"Any suit, the value of which was above rs. 1,00,000, had to be filed in the High Court on its Original Side.",6
4,"Accord ingly, the plaint was presented in the High Court after paying the necessary court fee on the basis of the above valuation.",6
4,"After the respondent was served with the summons in the suit, he made an application before the High Court for taking the plaint off its file and for returning it to the appellant for filing the same in the proper court.",6
4,"The respondent stated in the application that on a plain reading of the definition of the expression 'tenant in the Act, the respondent continued to be the tenant even after the termi nation of his contractual tenancy and did not become an unauthorised occupant of the accommodation and he was, therefore, liable to pay rent at the rate of Rs, 1400 per month till the date of the suit.",6
4,"He further stated that calculated on the above basis, the respondent would be liable to pay rs. 14,000 only by way of arrears of rent for the period between 1st February, 1985 and 30th November, 1985 instead of Rs.78,000 claimed by the appellant by way of mesne profits/ damages for the said period.",6
4,"The respondent contended that the valuation of the suit for purposes of jurisdiction would be Rs.42,000 only and that the value of the suit being less than rs. 1,00,000 it had to be filed in the City Civil Court of Calcutta.",6
4,"The respondent, therefore, prayed that the plaint should be returned for presentation to the proper court by virtue of section 15 of the Code which provided that every suit should be instituted in the court of the lowest grade competent to try it.",1
4,The learned Judge on hearing the above application accepted the plea of the respondent that under the provisions of the Act the expression 'tenant' included a person continuing in posses sion of the accommodation even after the termination of his contractual tenancy and on such termination the possession of a tenant did not become wrongful.,3
4,"The learned Judge, therefore, held that the appellant was not entitled to claim mesne profits/damages at the rate of Rs.7,800 per month from 1st February, 1985 to 30th November, 1985 aggregating to Rs.78,000 but was entitled to recover rs. 14,000 only at the rate of rs. 1,400 per month in respect of that period.",3
4,"The learned Judge found that the suit should have been valued at Rs.42,000 and not at rs. 1,06,000 and that the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the said suit.",3
4,"Accordingly, the learned Judge directed that the plaint should be re turned to the appellant for presentation to the proper court.",3
4,"Aggrieved by the decision of the learned Judge, the appellant has filed the above appeal by special leave before this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.",1
4,"Under section 15 of the Code every plaint should be instituted in the court of the lowest grade competent to try it and if the value of the suit was Rs.42,000 only it had to be filed in the City Civil Court of Calcutta and not on the Original Side of the High Court.",0
4,The principles which regulate the pecuniary jurisdic tion of civil courts are wellsettled.,1
4,"Ordinarily, the valua tion of a suit depends upon the reliefs claimed therein and the plaintiff's valuation in his plaint determines the Court in which it can be presented.",1
4,It is also true that the plaintiff cannot invoke the jurisdiction of a court by either grossly over valuing or grossly under valuing a suit.,1
4,The Court always has the jurisdiction to prevent the abuse of the process of law.,1
4,Under rule 10 of Order 7 of the Code the plaint can be returned at any stage of the suit for presentation to the court in which the suit should have been instituted.,0
4,The question for consideration in this case is whether in the present case the plaint has been grossly over valued with the object of bringing it within the juris diction of the High Court.,1
4,"When the suit is filed for the recovery of money, the amount claimed has to be included in determining the value of the suit.",1
4,"In the instant case the appellant has claimed a decree for Rs.78,000 (at the rate of Rs.7,800 per month) for the period between 1st February, 1985 and 30th November, 1985 on the footing that the re spondent's possession was unauthorised or illegal and he was liable to pay mesne profits or damages.",1
4,"The question whether the appellant would be entitled to a decree for mesne prof its/ damages at the rate of Rs.7,800 per month or at any other rate after the termination of the tenancy is a matter which has to be decided in the suit.",1
4,"If ultimately it is found that the appellant is not entitled to get mesne prof its or damages for the period subsequent to 1st February, 1985 and that she is only entitled to receive rs. 1,400 per month, the suit in respect of the claim over and above rs. 1,400 per month, will have to be dismissed.",1
4,"But the question whether she was entitled to claim mesne profits or damages in respect of the period subsequent to 1st February, 1985 could not have been disposed of at a preliminary stage even before the trial had commenced.",1
4,That question has to be decided at the conclusion of the trial along with other issues arising in the suit.,1
4,Having regard to some of the decisions on which reliance is placed by the appellant in the course of the appeal we are of the view that the matter is not free from doubt.,1
4,The claim for mesne profits/ damages is neither palpably absurd nor imaginary.,1
4,It needs judicial consideration.,1
4,The acceptance of the view put forward by the respondent may lead to encouraging a tenant who has forfeit ed his right to the tenancy to carry on a dilatory litiga tion without compensating the landlord suitably for the loss suffered by him on account of the unreasonable deprivation of the possession of his premises over a long period until he is able to get possession of the premises through the Court.,1
4,"We cannot, therefore, state at this stage that the claim for mesne profits/damages had been made without good faith and with the sole object of instituting the said suit before the High Court of Calcutta even though it had no jurisdiction to try it.",1
4,"We do not agree with the submission made on behalf of the respondent that the appellant had ""dishonestly and intentionally inflated the value of the suit in order to invite the jurisdiction of a particular court which has no jurisdiction otherwise."" If mesne profits/damages are found to be payable then the claim made at the rate of Rs.7,800 per month for a premises of the nature in question which is situated in Calcutta does not appear to be fanciful having regard to the prevailing situation.",1
4,We however express no opinion on the Actual amount that may be awarded as mesne profits/damages in the event of the liability to pay it being established.,1
4,We are of the view that on the facts and in the circum stances of the case the High Court was in error in prejudg ing the issue relating to the right of the appellant to claim mesne profits/damages and in directing that the plaint should be returned for presentation to the proper court.,4
4,"We, therefore, set aside the order passed by the High Court and direct the High Court to proceed with the hearing of the suit.",4
4,"We also direct that the observations made by the learned Judge in the course of the order against which this appeal is filed regarding the right of the appellant to claim the mesne profits/damages at the rate of Rs.7,800 per month shall not be binding on the parties and that the said question shall be decided afresh by the High Court in the course of the trial.",4
4,"We, however, express no opinion on the correctness or otherwise of the observations made by the learned Judge on the above question.",4
4,The appeal is accordingly allowed.,4
4,Appeal allowed,4
5,Leave granted.,4
5,Respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court of Madras seeking a direction to the petitioner to apply the rule of reservation to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in respect of those seats which are set apart for All India Pool in the M.B.B.S. or B.D.S. list.,1
5,"He had applied specifically in the category of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe for the All India Pre medical Entrance Examination, 1999.",6
5,"However, when the results were published, he found that no separate list had been published in respect of that category.",6
5,"He contended that there is a constitutional obligation to provide a special reservation to the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes in the all India quota as otherwise, it would be violation of Article 15 (4) of the Constitution of India.",6
5,He sought for a direction to apply the rule of reservation.,6
5,"A learned single Judge of the High Court held that the seats that are made available from various States are normally subject to the rule of reservation and the 15% of the seats allowed to the all India quota would, in the ordinary circumstances, have been reserved for the scheduled caste and schedule tribe candidates but for the directions of this Court under a scheme.",3
5,"He also noticed that there is no specific order of this Court not to apply the reservation rule to all India quota which is provided only to overcome the difficulty of residential requirement and, therefore, these seats must also provide for reservation on the ground of social and economic backwardness in terms of Article 15 (4) and the directives principles of State policy.",3
5,"Thus, he allowed the writ petition directing to set apart and reserve seats for the socially and educationally backward classes as per the policy of the Government making it clear that out of the 15% of the seats allocated, there should be reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.",3
5,"Against that order, a writ appeal was preferred by the petitioner herein with an application seeking interim order for stay of the judgment of the learned single Judge.",6
5,"A limited interim order was granted to the effect that if the 15% reservation is notionally implemented and the first respondent is found eligible to get admission under that quota, he should be given admission.",3
5,It is against this order this special leave petition is filed.,6
5,"Considering the nature of the matter and the issues involved in the case, the learned counsel on both sides agreed that we should transfer the writ appeal that had been filed and dispose of the same on merits instead of merely considering the appeal against the interim order made on the interlocutory application.",1
5,"Hence, we proceed to transfer under Article 139A the writ appeal (filed in the High Court) to this Court and dispose of the same by this order.",0
5,"In Dr. Dinesh Kumar and others (II) vs Motilal Nehru Medical College, Allahabad and others, JT 1986 (2) SC 97 1986 Indlaw SC 178, the question of 15% of the total seats being made available for admission to M.B.B.S. or B.D.S. course without taking into account any reservation made by the State Government was considered in the following manner :",5
5,"""Firstly, it was contended that the suggestion that 15 per cent of the total seats available for admission to M.B.B.S./B.D.S. course without taking into account any reservations which may be made by the State Government, would tend to produce inequality of opportunity for admission to students in different States since the percentage of reservations varied from State to State and",5
5,"secondly, it was urged that the proposal of the Government of India that valid reservations should not exceed 50 per cent of the total number of seats available for admission, will reduce the opportunities which were at present available to scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and backward classes as a result of reservations exceeding 50 per cent of the total seats made in some of the States and particularly in the State of Tamil Nadu, where the reservations exceed 68 per cent.",5
5,"We agree with the second objection raised on behalf of some of the State Governments but so far as the first objection is concerned, we do not think it is well founded.",5
5,"There can be no doubt that if in each State, 30 per cent of the seats were to be made available for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination after taking into account reservations validly made, the number of seats which would be available for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination would vary inversely with the percentage of reservations validly made in that State.",5
5,"If the percentage of reservations is high as in the State of Tamil Nadu or the State of Karnataka, the number of seats available for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination would be relatively less than what would be in a State where the percentage of reservations is low.",5
5,There would thus be total inequality in the matter of making available seats for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination.,5
5,It would be open to a State Government to reduce the number of seats available for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination by increasing the number of reserved categories or by increasing the percentage of reservations.,5
5,"We, therefore, agree with the Government of India that the formula adopted by us in our main judgment dated June 22, 1984, for determining the number of seats which should be made available for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination should be changed.",5
5,"We would direct, in accordance with the suggestion made in the scheme by the Government of India, that not less than 15 per cent of the total number of seats in each medical college or institution, without taking into account any reservations validly made, shall be filled on the basis of All India Entrance Examination.",5
5,"This new formula is, in our opinion, fair and just and brings about real equality of opportunity in admissions to the M.B.B.S./B.D.S. course without placing the students in one State in an advantageous or disadvantageous position as compared to the students in another State.",5
5,"The same formula must apply also in regard to admissions to the postgraduate courses and instead of making available for admission on All India basis, 50 per cent of the open seats after taking into account reservations validly made, we would direct that not less than 25 per cent of the total number of seats without taking into account any reservations, shall be made available for being filled on the basis of All India Entrance Examination.",5
5,"This suggestion of the Government of India deserves to be accepted and the objection to it must be overruled.""",5
5,(Emphasis supplied),1
5,"In respect of undergraduate course, the scheme works out like this.",1
5,"If a State has a total of 100 seats and in that State, 15% of the seats are reserved for scheduled castes and 10% for scheduled tribes, State will fill up 15% seats for scheduled caste candidates and 10% for scheduled tribe candidates, of the remaining 75 seats, 60 seats will be filled by the State Government as un reserved and 15 seats will be earmarked for all India quota.",1
5,"Inasmuch as 15% all India quota has been earmarked under the scheme framed by this Court and that scheme itself provides the manner in which the same should be worked out, we do not think, it would be appropriate to travel outside the said provisions to find out whether a person in the position of the petitioner would be entitled to plead in the manner sought for because each of the States could also provide for reservation for scheduled caste and schedule tribe category in respect of 85% of the seats available with them.",1
5,"If we meddle with this quota fixed, we are likely to land in innumerable and insurmountable difficulties.",1
5,"Each State will have different categories of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and Central Government may have a different category and hence, adjustment of seats would become difficult.",1
5,"The direction fixing 15% quota for all India basis takes note of reservations and hence, the High Court need not have made any further directions.",1
5,"In Ajit Singh and others (II) vs State of Punjab and others, 2000 (1) AWC 574 (SC) : JT 1999 (7) SC 153 1999 Indlaw SC 627, this Court held that Article 16 (4) of the Constitution confers a discretion and does not create any constitutional duty and obligation.",5
5,"Language of Article 15 (4) is identical and the view in Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Gian Prakash vs Jagannathan, 1986 (2) SCC 679 1986 Indlaw SC 806 and Superintending Engineer, Public Health vs Kuldeep Singh, JT 1997 (2) SC 508 1997 Indlaw SC 2284, that a mandamus can be issued either to provide for reservation or for relaxation is not correct and runs counter to judgments of earlier Constitution Benches and, therefore, these two judgments cannot be held to be laying down the correct law.",5
5,"In these circumstances, neither the respondent in the present case could have sought for a direction nor the High Court could have granted the same.",1
5,"Hence, we allow the writ appeal transferred to this Court and set aside order made in the writ petition.",4
5,The appeal also shall stands disposed of.,4
5,Appeal disposed of,4
6,This appeal is preferred by the State of U.P against the acquittal recorded by the High Court.,6
6,The respondent was put to trial under Section 302/376 IPC.,6
6,The trial court after conclusion of the trial convicted the respondent and sentenced him to RI for life under Section 302 IPC.,3
6,The respondent was also sentenced to 7 years RI under Section 376 IPC.,6
6,"Aggrieved thereby, the respondent preferred the appeal before the High Court.",6
6,The High Court by the impugned order acquitted the accused.,6
6,"Hence, the present appeal.",6
6,"The story as unfolded by the prosecution is as follows: On 21 2 1979 the prosecutrix, aged about 10 years, stated to be disappeared and was missing.",6
6,"Since the victim girl did not return P.W.1, Braj Lai the father of the complainant made an abortive search for her and thereafter filed an FIR on 22 2 1979 at 8.15 p.m.",6
6,The case was registered under Section 302/376 IPC.,6
6,In the course of the investigation the prosecution examined as many as eight witnesses.,6
6,"The prosecution mainly relied on the evidence of P.Ws. 2, 5, 6 and 7 who are the witnesses with regard to the last seen of the accused with the victim.",6
6,"Prosecution also examined P.W.3, Dr. A.N. Saxena who conducted the postmortem examination of the deceased.",6
6,"The prosecution also examined PW.l, Braj Lai who is an author of the FIR.",6
6,The case of the prosecution rests entirely on circumstantial evidence.,1
6,"The trial court after examining evidence of P.Ws.2, 5, 6 and 7 has come to the conclusion that the chain of circumstantial evidence appearing against the accused was completely established and recorded order of conviction.",6
6,"The trial court was of the opinion that the statement of P.W.2, Sakuntla, P.W.5 Ram Bahadur, P.W.6 Kamta Prasad, who is a teacher and P.W.7 Virendra Singh has credence and there is no reason to discredit their credit worthy evidence with regard to the last seen of the accused with the victim.",6
6,"Before we advert to the evidence of the witnesses, we may take notice of the evidence of P.W.3, Dr. A.N. Saxena who conducted the postmortem examination of the victim.",1
6,"P.W.3, Dr.",6
6,Saxena stated that the postmortem examination of the deceased Nanhi was performed on 23 2 1979 at 3.30 p.m. and on physical examination he found that the victim girl was aged about 10 years old with an average built.,6
6,P.W.3 opined that the death had occurred two days earlier.,6
6,Rigor mortis has passed off.,6
6,"On examination of vaginal parts, P.W.3 found that there was vaginal bleeding.",6
6,Hymen was lacerated with red edges.,6
6,Edges of labia minora were bruised.,6
6,"On examining the physical body of the deceased, P.W.3 found the following injuries:",6
6,"(1)Multiple intempted abraded contusions in an area of 6 cm x 2 cm on right side neck, 2 cms. below angle of mandible.",6
6,"(2)Multiple intempted abraded contusions on right side face in an area of 7 cm. x 3 cm., 3 cms. in from of right ear.",6
6,(3)Multiple intempted abraded contusions on left side neck in area of 5 cm.,6
6,"X 2 cm., 6 cm. below left ear.",6
6,(4)Abraded contusion 3 cm. x 1 cm. on left side cheek. 2 cm. infront of lest ear.,6
6,(5)Abrasion 1 cm.,6
6,"X 1/2 cm. on right side front of chest, 4 cm. below started end of right clavicle.",6
6,P.W.3 opined that the deceased was raped before her murder which took place on 21 2 1979 at about 6.30 or 7 p.m.,6
6,He further opined that the death was occurred due to asphyxia on account of strangulation.,6
6,This doctor was subjected to lengthy cross examination.,6
6,Nothing could be elicited from the cross examination to discredit otherwise the creditworthy of his testimony.,1
6,"At this stage since the conviction was entirely rests on circumstantial evidence, we may also point out that the clinching evidence appearing against the accused and which was not explained by him.",1
6,"From the testimony of P.W.3 it appears that the victim girl, apart from other injuries, suffered many lacerated multiple intempted contusions on the face and on the right ear.",1
6,Multiple abraded contusions on the left ear and on the left cheek and in front of the left ear.,1
6,Abrasion 1 cm. x 1/2 cm. on right side from of chest and 4 cm. below start end of right clavicle.,1
6,The injuries described on the body of the deceased by the P.W.3 clearly suggest that the victim girl struggled and resisted the attempt of rape.,1
6,It is in the evidence of P.W.I. Braj Lai that when he went to the accused to inquire about the whereabouts of his daughter he saw scratch marks on the face of the accused.,1
6,This question was put to the accused but he simply denied as wrong.,1
6,No explanation whatsoever has been given by the deceased (?).,1
6,"We are, therefore, of the view that this clinching evidence against the accused remains unchallenged.",1
6,"P.W.2, Shakuntala was stated to be aged about 12 or 13 years old at the time of occurrence.",1
6,"She deposed that at about 5 or 5.30 p.m. she had seen the accused with the victim girl eating ""BERS"".",1
6,She further deposed that the accused climbed the tree.,1
6,She further deposed that she saw the accused and victim girl when she had gone to field to fetch fodder.,1
6,This witness was subject to cross examination but she withstood the lengthy cross examination.,1
6,"P.W.5, Ram Bahadur is also a resident of the same village.",1
6,He deposed that he had seen the accused with the deceased at about 5 or 5.30 p.m. on the date of occurrence.,1
6,"In cross examination he deposed that complainant Braj Lai, the accused and this witness all belong to the brotherhood.",1
6,"There is no reason to doubt the veracity of the witness as because this witness, complainant and accused were belonged to the same brotherhood and there is no reason to doubt as to why this witness would depose falsely against the accused.",1
6,"P.W.6, Kamta Prasad is a school teacher.",1
6,He was teaching in Jiwanpur School on the date of occurrence.,1
6,He stated that when he went to meet master Devi Singh he was not available so he was returning at about 6 p.m.,1
6,About 7 p.m. he saw the accused and the deceased going towards the orchard feild of Jai Ram.,1
6,At this stage we may point out that the last seen before the murder was seen by P.W.6 who saw the accused along with the deceased going towards orchard field of Jai Ram.,1
6,It will be pertinent to point out here that the dead body of the deceased was found at orchard field of Jai Ram.,1
6,This witness also stated that he had told P.W.1 that he has seen Brajh Lai's daughter with the accused at that time.,1
6,"The trial court has accepted his evidence as creditworthy because he is a responsible witness being a teacher, an independent and disinterested witness.",1
6,We have nothing to doubt the creditworthy of this evidence.,1
6,"Next last seen together witness is Virendra Singh, P.W.7.",1
6,He deposed that at about 7.30 p.m. he had seen the accused Desh Raj emerging from his field.,1
6,He further deposed that the accused was in a nervous state of mind.,1
6,On enquiring by the witness from the accused why so nervous the accused gave no reply and went away to his house.,1
6,In cross examination this witness stated that he had seen the accused after coming back from the marriage party.,1
6,Counsel for the respondent contended that the testimony of this witness is not reliable as in cross examination this witness stated that he had witnessed the accused and the deceased only on return from the marriage party.,2
6,"According to the counsel for the respondent this witness had gone to the marriage party on the date of incident, he could not have seen the accused and the victim girl together as deposed by him.",2
6,This has been clarified to a question put by the Court by P.W.7 and he categorically admitted that he saw the accused emerging from the field after his return from the marriage party.,1
6,This does not mean that he went to the marriage party on the same day.,1
6,"The High Court, in our view, erroneously held that the evidence of P.Ws. 2, 5, 6 and 7 could not establish the chain of circumstantial evidence only pointing to the guilt of the accused.",1
6,"By now, it is well settled principle that in order to sustain a conviction of circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must establish that the chain of circumstances only consistently point to the guilt of the accused and inconsistence with his innocence.",1
6,"A cumulative reading of the evidence of P.Ws. 2, 5, 6 and 7 together with the medical evidence and non explanation of the accused scratch marks on his face, we are of the view that the prosecution has consistently established the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with his innocence.",1
6,"The High Court, therefore, was not justified in recording the acquittal of the accused.",1
6,The impugned order of the High Court acquitting the accused respondent is accordingly quashed and set aside.,4
6,"The accused is on bail, his bail bonds and sureties stand cancelled.",4
6,He is directed to be taken back to custody forthwith.,4
6,Compliance within one month.,4
6,The appeal is allowed accordingly.,4
6,Appeal allowed.,4
7,Challenge in these appeals is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court.,6
7,"The Civil Revision petitions in proceedings under Order 34 Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short the 'Code') were dismissed by a common judgment dated 02 June 1997.",6
7,"Factual position, which is practically undisputed need to be noted in brief.",1
7,The decrees for sale in the above cases were passed on 08 February 1989 and 30 July 1985 respectively.,6
7,"At the time of passing the decrees in the case, amendments as applicable to the State of Kerala were in force.",6
7,"The amendment stood repealed by virtue of section 97(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Act 104 of 1976)(in short the 'Amendment Act') which came into force on 01 February 1977.",1
7,"By an amendment effected section 122 of the Code, by the High Court of Kerala, Order 34 of the Code as existed before 01 February 1977 was incorporated in the Code with effect from 20 November 1990.",1
7,"It is thus clear that on the dates when decrees were passed in the case, the Civil Procedure Code was in force in the State of Kerala.",1
7,The prayer for redemption in terms of Order 34 Rule 5 of the Code as made by the judgment debtors was rejected.,6
7,The High Court held that the petitions under Order 34 Rule 5 were not maintainable on two grounds namely.,3
7,"U/s. 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (in short the 'Act') right to redemption continues to inhere in a mortgage only until it is extinguished by act of parties or by a decree of Court.",1
7,"By the passing of a decree, the mortgage security merges in the decree and is replaced by the security of the order of sale.",1
7,Accordingly the right of redemption is extinguished by the final decree under Order 34 Rule 5(3) of Code.,1
7,Reliance was placed on a decis ion of the Patna High Court in Sheo Narain Sah vs Mt. Deolchan Kuer (AIR 1943 Patna 208).,2
7,"Though a right under Order 34 Rule 5 was available under the Code, after the substitution of Order XXXIV by the Kerala amendment there is no such right available to the Mortgagor.",1
7,Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the High Court's view is clearly untenable.,2
7,"First, the Kerala amendment became non est. because of the Amendment Act.",1
7,"Secondly, the view expressed by the Patna High Court was not approved by this Court.",1
7,"Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand submitted that it was commonly believed that the Kerala amendment introduced on 15 January 1974 was in force at all times and the fresh amendment done in November, 1990 was just by way of clarification that it was effective till the amendment.",2
7,"High Court has held that by the passing of the decree for sale, the mortgage debt is merged into the decree and thereafter right to redemption is not available.",1
7,"In taking that view, the High Court has relied on the decision of the Patna High Court in Sheo Narayan's case (supra).",1
7,The view taken by the Patna High Court was held to be not the correct view as observed by this Court in Mhadagonda Ramgonda Patil and Ors. vs Shripal Balwant Rainade & Ors. (1988 (3) SCC 298 1988 Indlaw SC 456).,5
7,It was held that unless and until a decree of order debarring the mortgagor from redeeming the property is passed under Sub Rule 3(a) of Rule 8 of Order XXXIV the right of redemption is available.,5
7,It was inter alia held as follows:,5
7,It is thus manifestly clear that the right of redemption will be extinguished (1) by the act of the parties or (2) by the decree of a court.,5
7,We are not concerned with the question of extinguishment of the right of redemption by the act of the parties.,5
7,The question is whether by the preliminary decree or final decree passed in the earlier extinguished.,5
7,"The decree that is referred to in the proviso to section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act is a final decree in a suit for foreclosure, as provided in sub rule (2) of Rule 3 of Order 34 and a final decree in a redemption suit as provided in Order 34, Rule 8(3)(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure.",5
7,"Sub rule (2) of Rule 3, inter alia, provides that where payment in accordance with sub rule (1) has not been made, the court shall, on an application made by the plaintiff in this behalf, pass a final decree declaring that the defendant and all persons claiming through or under him are debarred from all right to redeem the mortgaged property and also, if necessary, ordering the defendant to put the plaintiff in possession of the property.",5
7,"Thus, in a final decree in a suit for foreclosure, on the failure of the defendant to pay all amounts due, the extinguishment of the right of redemption has to be specifically declared.",5
7,"Again, in a final decree in a suit for redemption of mortgage by conditional sale or for redemption of an anomalous mortgage, the extinguishment of the right of redemption has to be specifically declared, as provided in clause (a) of sub rule (3) of Rule 8 of Order 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure.",1
7,"These are the two circumstances (1) a final decree in a suit for foreclosure under Order 34, Rule 3(2); and (2) a final decree in a suit for redemption under Order 34, Rule 8(3)(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure when the right of redemption is extinguished.",1
7,"In the instant case, the earlier suit was not a suit for foreclosure nor was either of the mortgages, a mortgage by conditional sale or an anomalous mortgage and, accordingly, there was no declaration in the final decree passed in the earlier suit for redemption that the respondents would be debarred from all right to redeem the mortgaged property.",1
7,Rule 5(1) of Order 34 expressly recognized the right of the mortgagor to redeem the mortgage at any time before the confirmation of a sale made in pursuance of a final decree passed in a suit for sale.,1
7,"Similarly, Rule 8(1) of Order 34 permits the mortgagor to redeem the mortgaged property before the confirmation of the sale held in pursuance of a final decree in a redemption suit, unless such final decree debars the mortgagor from all right to redeem the mortgaged property which, as noticed earlier, is provided for in sub rule (3)(a) of Rule 8 of Order 34 relating to a mortgage by conditional sale or an anomalous mortgage.",1
7,"Thus, the provisions of Order 34 have laid down in clear terms the circumstances when the right of redemption of the mortgagor would stand extinguished.",1
7,"It is also clear that in a suit for redemption, a mortgage other than a mortgage by conditional sale or an anomalous mortgage, the mortgagor has a right of redemption even after the sale has taken place pursuant to the final decree, but before the confirmation of such sale.",1
7,"In view of these provisions, the question of merger of mortgage debt in the decretal debt does not at all arise.",1
7,"We are, therefore, of the view that the decision in Sheo Narain case in so far as it lays down the merger of the mortgage debt in the decretal debt and the consequent extinguishment of the right of redemption of the mortgagor after the passing of the final decree in a suit for redemption is erroneous.""",1
7,"As there is no such final decree in this case, the right of the mortgagor to redeem the property is available to him till the confirmation of the sale in pursuance to the decree.",1
7,"The High Court further held that the right of redemption provided for under Order XXXIV Rule 5 is not available to the appellants in view of the fact that by the time the applications were filed, the Code as amended by substituting Order XXXIV do not contain a similar provision with effect from 20 November 1990.",1
7,This view is also not correct.,1
7,The decrees in the case were passed at a time when the Code was in force in the State of Kerala and the amendment in 1974 so far as the State of Kerala is concerned was not operative.,1
7,Composite decrees were passed in both under order XXXIV Rule 4 and 5 together.,1
7,"Those were the provisions in regard to enforcement of mortgages, and whatever may be the wording of the decree, they shall be deemed to be passed under Order XXXIV Rule 5 as it stood at the time of the passing of the decree.",1
7,It is not necessary that all the clauses mentioned in the provisions under which the decree is passed should be incorporated in the decree.,1
7,"While interpreting such a decree, it must be read as if all the provisions therein are incorporated in the decree.",1
7,"The Court may not at the time of passing of the decree, be aware as to which contingency will happen in future.",1
7,Each of the decrees was under Order XXXIV Rule 5 of the Code as it stood before 20 November 1990.,1
7,"The effect of section 97(1) of the Amendment Act is that all the local amendments made to any of the provisions of the Code either by a State Legislature or by a High Court which were inconsistent with the Code as amended by the Amendment Act stood repealed irrespective of the fact whether the corresponding provision of the Code had been amended or modified by the Amendment Act and that was subject only to what was found in sub section (2) of Section 97. (See Ganpat Giri vs IInd Additional District Judge, Balia and Ors. (AIR 1986 SC 589 1986 Indlaw SC 313).",5
7,"That being so, till 20 November 1990, the Kerala amendment was not effective from 01 February 1977.",1
7,While considering a case interpreting Order XX Rule 12 of the Code in Chittoori Subbanna Vs.,5
7,Kudappa Subbanna (AIR 1965 SC 1325 1964 Indlaw SC 231) this Court laid down the principles to be followed in interpreting such decrees when the decree has not specifically mentioned all the clauses in the provision under which the decree is passed.,5
7,Right of redemption of a mortgage is a substantive right of Mortgagor which has accrued to him to be exercised under Order XXXIV Rule 5 of the Code when the decree was passed which cannot be taken away by the amendment of order XXXIV of the Code which was made only after the decree in this case.,5
7,"An application under Order XXXIV Rule 5 is maintainable until the final determination of proceedings to set aside the sale under Order XXXIV either by way of appeal or revision.

7,"In C.A. 1488 89 of 2000 proceedings under order XXI Rule 90 were pending and they were finally decided in C.M.A 353 of 1995 by order dated 02 June 1997, along with the main order.",1
7,In C.A. No.1490 91 of 2000 proceedings under Order 21 Rule 89 to set aside the sale was finally decided only by the order dated 02 June 1997 in C.M.A. 18 of 1993 and the application under Order 34 Rule 5 was filed earlier.,1
7,It is also seen that no order has been passed by the Court confirming the sale as required under Order 21 Rule 92.,1

8,He worked for the period 13.12.1991 to 1.3.1994.,6
8,"After his services were terminated, an industrial dispute was raised.",6
8,The said dispute was referred for its determination before the Industrial Tribunal.,6
8,"The Industrial Tribunal by an Award dated 26.7.2002, while holding that in terminating the services of the respondents the appellant has failed to comply with the statutory requirements contained in section 25 F of the Industrial Disputes Act, awarded only retrenchment compensation alongwith notice pay together with interest @ 9% per annum.",6
8,Validity of the said Award was not questioned by the appellant.,6
8,"Respondent, however, filed a Writ Petition thereagainst.",6
8,"By a Judgment and Order dated 24.2.2005 and 15.4.2005, a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court allowed the said Writ Petition directing re instatement of the respondent with full back wages.",3
8,An intra court appeal preferred thereagainst has been dismissed by a Division Bench of the said Court by reason of the impugned judgment.,6
8,"Mr. Vikas Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the appellant would submit that Madhya Pradesh Bhawan being merely a Circuit House of the Government of Madhya Pradesh, is not an ""Industry"" within the meaning of section 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes Act.",2
8,"Learned counsel urged that in that view of the matter, it was not a fit case where a direction of re instatement with full back wages should have been issued.",2
8,"Mr. Sujoy Ghosh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, would submit that although the question as to whether sovereign functions of the State would come within the purview of the definition of ""Industry"" is pending for consideration before the Seven Judges' Bench having been referred to by a Constitution Bench in State of U.P. v Jai Bir Singh [(2005) 5 SCC 1 2005 Indlaw SC 766], but so long the existing law is not set aside, Madhya Pradesh Bhawan wherein even the private guests are also entertained would bring the establishment within the purview of ""Industry"".",2
8,"In any event, the industrial court having arrived at a finding to that effect in its Award dated 26.7.2002 which having not been questioned, the appellant cannot be permitted to raise the same before this Court.",6
8,"It was contended that artificial breaks after 89 days of service being not bonafide, the termination of the services of a workman would not come within the exceptions envisaged under section 2(oo) (bb) of the Act.",2
8,"It was urged that Industrial Disputes Act does not make any distinction between a daily wager and the permanent employee, in view of the definition of ""workman"" as contained in section 2(s) thereof.",2
8,"The High Court, therefore, cannot be said to have committed any illegality in directing the re instatement of the respondent with full back wages as admittedly the provisions of section 25 F of the Industrial Disputes Act had not been complied with.",1
8,"The question as to whether the activities of the Appellant satisfy the tests laid down in the statutory definition of ""Industry"" as contained in section 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes Act or not, in our opinion need not be gone into in this case.",1
8,Industrial Court opined that it was an Industry.,1
8,The legality of the Award of the Industrial Court was not questioned.,1

8,"It, therefore, in our opinion cannot now be permitted to turn round and contend that its Delhi establishment does not come within the purview of the definition of ""Industry"".",1
8,"The question, however, which arises for consideration is as to whether in a situation of this nature, the learned Single Judge and consequently the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court should have directed re instatement of the respondent with full back wages.",1
8,"Whereas at one point of time, such a relief used to be automatically granted, but keeping in view several other factors and in particular the doctrine of public employment and involvement of the public money, a change in the said trend is now found in the recent decisions of this Court.",1
8,This Court in a large number of decisions in the matter of grant of relief of the kind distinguished between a daily wager who does not hold a post and a permanent employee.,1
8,"It may be that the definition of ""workman"" as contained in section 2(s) of the Act is wide and takes within its embrage all categories of workmen specified therein, but the same would not mean that even for the purpose of grant of relief in an industrial dispute referred for adjudication, application for constitutional scheme of equality adumbrated articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India, in the light of a decision of a Constitution Bench of this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka and Others v Umadevi (3) and Others [(2006) 4 SCC 1 2006 Indlaw SC 125], and other relevant factors pointed out by the Court in a catena of decisions shall not be taken into consideration.",1

8,"Still then, 25% back wages were directed to be paid as also the compensation payable in terms of Section 6 N of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act.",1
8,The judgments of both the civil court and the criminal court established that the appellant was treated very unfairly and unreasonably.,1
8,"For all intent and purport, a criminal case was foisted upon him.",1

8,"We are however not addressing this plea of the respondents as we have already observed that Respondent 1 is not a workman under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the U.P. ID Act, 1947 and also that the retrenchment was not illegal and therefore the question of back wages does not arise.",1

8,"The question, however, would be as to whether in a situation of this nature, relief of reinstatement in services should have been granted.",5

9,Brief facts:,6
9,"(a) One Shri Lal Babu Priyadarshi the appellant herein, trading as M/s Om Perfumery, Bakerganj, Daldali Road, Patna made an application to the Registrar of Trade Marks to register a trade mark by name ""RAMAYAN"" with the device of crown in class 3 in respect of incense sticks (agarbattis, dhoops) and perfumeries etc.",6
9,"(b) One Shri Amritpal Singh the respondent herein, was a dealer for the sale of the products of the appellant herein and was also trading as M/s Badshah Industries, Chitkohra, Punjabi Colony, Patna.",6
9,"The respondent herein filed a Notice of Opposition to oppose the registration of aforesaid trade mark under Sections 9, 11(a), 11(b), 11(e), 12(1), 12(3) and 18(1) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 [repealed by the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (47 of 1999) in short 'the Act'] claiming that the impugned mark, being the name of a religious book, cannot become the subject matter of monopoly for an individual.",6
9,"(c) The Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks, after holding that the impugned trade mark consists of device of crown and the word ""RAMAYAN"" is capable of distinguishing the goods and is not included in the list of marks not registrable under the Act, by order dated 31.03.2004, dismissed the application filed by the respondent herein.",6
9,"(d) Being aggrieved by the order dated 31.03.2004, the respondent herein preferred an appeal before the Board being Original Appeal no. 35/2004/TM/KOL.",6
9,"The Board, by order dated 10.01.2005, set aside the order dated 31.03.2004, passed by the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks.",6
9,"(e) Aggrieved by the order dated 10.01.2005, the appellant has filed this appeal by way of special leave.",6
9,"Heard Ms. Anuradha Salhotra, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. Sudhir Chandra, learned senior counsel for the respondent.",1
9,"The sole question for consideration before this Court is whether the registration of the word ""RAMAYAN"" as a trade mark, being the name of a Holy Book of Hindus, is prohibited under Section 9(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999?",1
9,Rival submissions:,2
9,"Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant was in the business of manufacturing, trading and marketing of incense sticks since 1981 and the respondent herein was a dealer of the appellant herein.",2
9,"The goods under the trade mark ""RAMAYAN"" have been advertised by him through various means including the publication of cautionary notices in newspapers.",2
9,"Learned counsel further submitted that through extensive use, wide advertisement and the excellent quality of the products, the trademark ""RAMAYAN"" and the carton in which the products are sold has become distinctive in such a manner that use of the same or similar trademark or carton by any other person will cause confusion and deception in the trade and amongst the public.",2
9,The sale was done through a network of dealers and distributors and the respondent herein was a dealer of the appellant herein.,2
9,"Learned counsel submitted that after the termination of dealership, the respondent herein started selling incense sticks under the trade mark ""RAMAYAN"" written in the same style and manner.",2
9,"Learned counsel further contended that the mere fact that the trade mark, being the name of a religious book, cannot be a sufficient ground for refusal of registration under Section 9(2) of the Act and is not based on evidence on record that the feelings of any section of the Hindus having been hurt by its use in relation to incense sticks.",2
9,She further submitted that the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks rightly held that the impugned trade mark consists of device of crown and the word is capable of distinguishing the goods of the appellant herein and the trade mark is not included in the list of marks not registrable under the Act.,2
9,"She further claimed that it has already been proved before the Court of Assistant Registrar that the appellant was using the trade mark since 1981 and hence, is the prior user in comparison to the respondent.",2
9,"According to the learned counsel, the Board, totally misconstrued the observations of the Standing Committee in the Eighth Report on the Trade Marks Bill, 1993.",2
9,"Relying upon Clause 13.3 of the said report, it was submitted that even though the Committee had observed that ""any symbol relating to religious gods, goddesses, places of worship should not ordinarily be registered as a trade mark"", it specifically refrained from prohibiting registration of such marks.",2
9,It was further submitted that the Board has erroneously relied upon the decision of this Court in Registrar of Trade Marks vs Ashok Chandra Rakhit AIR 1955 SC 558 1955 Indlaw SC 88 by proceeding on the basis that the said case was an authority on the question that all religious names or symbols are prohibited from being registered whereas the fact of the matter is that this Court had merely upheld the concurrent findings of the Registrar and the High Court that the word 'SHREE' was incapable of distinguishing the goods of any one trader.,2
9,"The said case is also distinguishable by the fact that it was the invariable practice of the trade mark office not to register the word 'SHREE' but this is not so with the word ""RAMAYAN"".",2
9,"Relying upon a decision of this Court in Mumbai International Airport Private Limited vs Golden Chariot Airport and Another (2010) 10 SCC 422 2010 Indlaw SC 776, it is further submitted that the respondent herein had himself claimed the use of the identical mark and therefore, it did not lie in his mouth to object to the registration of the word in the name of the appellant.",2
9,She further contended that the Board ought to have seen that there are several cases which indicate that the use of the names of Hindu deities as trade mark is a common practice and no one has complained about the same being sensitive to Hindu religious sentiments for which reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar vs Sri Ambal & Co. AIR 1970 SC 146 1969 Indlaw SC 170.,2
9,"Learned counsel also placed reliance on Corn Products Refining Co. vs Shangrila Food Products Ltd. 1960 (1) SCR 968 1959 Indlaw SC 211 in support of the submission that before the applicant can seek to derive assistance for the success of his application from the presence of a number of marks having one or more common features which occur in his mark also, he has to prove that those marks had acquired a reputation by user in the market.",2
9,"Learned counsel finally contended that the Board erred in law while setting aside the judgment of the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks while holding adversely about its distinctiveness, the mark causing deception and not having been used in an honest manner.",2
9,"Learned senior counsel for the respondent contended that the impugned mark, being name of a religious book, cannot become the subject matter of monopoly for an individual.",2
9,"He further contended that the mark ""RAMAYAN"" is not a distinctive mark and is devoid of any distinctive character.",2
9,The mark is not capable of distinguishing the goods of one person from those of another.,2
9,"It was also contended that the mark ""RAMAYAN"" is not registrable since it is the name of a famous and well known religious book.",2
9,It was also claimed that more than 20 traders in Patna and many more are using the trade mark and thus it has become public juris.,2
9,"In support of the same, learned senior counsel placed reliance upon a decision of this Court in National Bell Co. vs Metal Goods Mfg. Co. (P) Ltd. and Another 1970 (3) SCC 665 1970 Indlaw SC 524.",2
9,"He further submitted that the impugned mark is identical with the respondent's mark ""BADSHAH RAMAYAN"" which is pending registration and the impugned registration will cause harassment to other traders and purchasing public would be bound to be confused and deceived.",2
9,Learned senior counsel finally claimed that the Board was right in setting aside the order dated 31.03.2004 passed by the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks.,2
9,We have carefully gone through the relevant documents and perused the material on record.,1
9,Discussion:,1
9,"The appellant herein filed an application dated 25.08.1994 being no. 638073 B in class 3 for registration of a trade mark consisting of the word ""RAMAYAN"" with the device of crown in respect of incense sticks (agarbatties) and perfumeries etc.",1
9,The appellant herein claimed the user since 01.01.1987.,1
9,He further filed a request to rectify the user from 01.01.1981 which was allowed by the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks.,1
9,"While opposing the application in class 3 for registration of the trade mark, the respondent herein filed a notice of opposition under Sections 9, 11(a), 11(b), 11(e), 12(1) and 18(1) of the Act.",1

9,"The application was further opposed with the reasoning that it carries a large sentimental value for the people and therefore, no one can claim sole right to the use of such a word.",1
9,"It was also admitted by the respondent herein that more than 20 traders in Patna are using the trade mark ""RAMAYAN"".",1
9,"Finally, it was submitted that the impugned mark is identical with the respondent's mark ""BADSHAH RAMAYAN"" which is pending registration and the impugned registration will cause confusion among general public.",1
9,"Though the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks dismissed the application filed by the respondent herein, the Board set aside the said order after holding that the trade mark ""RAMAYAN"" is not distinctive of the goods of the appellant as it is being used as a mark for the same products by more than 20 traders in Patna and in different parts of the country and has become public juris and common to the trade.",1
9,"In view of the above, it is relevant to mention Section 9 of the Act which reads as under:",0
9,Absolute grounds for refusal of registration (1) The trade marks,0
9,"(a) which are devoid of any distinctive character, that is to say, not capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of another person;",0
9,"(b) which consist exclusively of marks or indications which may serve in trade to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, values, geographical origin or the time of production of the goods or rendering of the service or other characteristics of the goods or service;",0
9,"(c) which consist exclusively of marks or indications which have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade, shall not be registered:",0
9,Provided that a trade mark shall not be refused registration if before the date of application for registration it has acquired a distinctive character as a result of the use made of it or is a well known trade mark.,0
9,(2) A mark shall not be registered as a trade mark if,0
9,(a) it is of such nature as to deceive the public or cause confusion;,0
9,(b) it contains or comprises of any matter likely to hurt the religious susceptibilities of any class or section of the citizens of India;,0
9,(c) it comprises or contains scandalous or obscene matter;,0
9,"(d) its use is prohibited under the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 (12 of 1950).",0
9,(3) A mark shall not be registered as a trade mark if it consists exclusively of,0
9,(a) the shape of goods which results from the nature of the goods themselves; or,0
9,(b) the shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result; or,0
9,(c) the shape which gives substantial value to the goods.,0
9,Explanation.,0
9,"For the purposes of this section, the nature of goods or services in relation to which the trade mark is used or proposed to be used shall not be a ground for refusal of registration.""",0
9,"This section stipulates that the trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character or which consist exclusively of marks or indications which may serve in trade to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, values, geographical origin or the time of production of goods or rendering of the services or other characteristics of the goods or service or which consist exclusively of marks or indications which have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established practice of the trade shall not be registered, unless it is shown that the mark has in fact acquired a distinctive character as a result of use before the date of application.",1
9,"It also provides that a mark shall not be registered as trade marks if (i) it deceives the public or causes confusion, (ii) it contains or comprises of any matter likely to hurt the religious susceptibilities, (iii) it contains scandalous or obscene matter, (iv) its use is prohibited.",1
9,"It further provides that if a mark consists exclusively of (a) the shape of goods which form the nature of goods themselves, or (b) the shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result, or (c) the shape which gives substantial value of the goods then it shall not be registered as trade mark.",1
9,"From Clause 13.3 of the Eighth Report on the Trade Marks Bill, 1993 submitted by the Parliamentary Standing Committee, we find that the Committee expressed its opinion that any symbol relating to Gods, Goddesses, places of worship should not ordinarily be registered as a trade mark.",1
9,"However, the Committee did not want to disturb the existing trade marks by prohibiting their registration as it will result in a chaos in the market.",1
9,"At the same time, the Committee trusted that Government will initiate appropriate action if someone complaints that a particular trade mark is hurting his religious susceptibilities.",1
9,This report was presented on 21.04.1994.,1
9,"When the report was presented, the appellant's trade mark had not been registered and the application filed by the respondent herein opposing its registration was dismissed only on 31.03.2004 by the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks.",1
9,"The word ""RAMAYAN"" represents the title of a book written by Maharishi Valmiki and is considered to be a religious book of the Hindus in our country.",1
9,"Thus, using exclusive name of the book ""RAMAYAN"", for getting it registered as a trade mark for any commodity could not be permissible under the Act.",1
9,"If any other word is added as suffix or prefix to the word ""RAMAYAN"" and the alphabets or design or length of the words are same as of the word ""RAMAYAN"" then the word ""RAMAYAN"" may lose its significance as a religious book and it may be considered for registration as a trade mark.",1
9,"However, in the present case, we find that the appellant had applied for registration of the word ""RAMAYAN"" as a trade mark.",1
9,"We also find that in the photographs, after adding ""OM's"" to the word ""RAMAYAN"", at the top and in between ""OM's and RAMAYAN"", the sentence, ""Three Top Class Aromatic Fragrance"", is also written.",1
9,"Thus, it is not a case that the appellant is seeking the registration of the word ""OM's RAMAYAN"" as a trade mark.",1
9,"Further, from the photographs, we find that the photographs of Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshman are also shown in the label which is a clear indication that the appellant is taking advantage of the Gods and Goddesses which is otherwise not permitted.",1
9,"In National Bell Co. 1970 Indlaw SC 524 (supra), this Court has held that the distinctiveness of the trade mark in relation to the goods of a registered proprietor of such a trade mark may be lost in a variety of ways e.g. by the goods not being capable of being distinguished as the goods of such a proprietor or by extensive piracy so that the marks become public juris.",5
9,The principle underlying clause (c) of Section 32 is that the property in a trade mark exists so long as it continues to be distinctive of the goods of the registered proprietor in the eyes of the public or a section of the public.,1
9,"If the proprietor is not in a position to use the mark to distinguish his goods from those of others or has abandoned it or the mark has become so common in the market that it has ceased to connect him with his goods, there would hardly be any justification in retaining it on the register.",1
9,"It has also come on record that the word ""RAMAYAN"" is being used as a mark for the similar products by more than 20 traders in Patna and in different parts of the country, and therefore, it has become public juris and common to the trade.",1
9,Conclusion:,1
9,"There are many holy and religious books like Quran, Bible, Guru Granth Sahib, Ramayan etc., to name a few.",1
9,The answer to the question as to whether any person can claim the name of a holy or religious book as a trade mark for his goods or services marketed by him is clearly 'NO'.,1
9,"Moreover, the appellant has not been able to establish that the word ""RAMAYAN"" for which he has applied the trade mark had acquired a reputation of user in the market inasmuch as, we find that there are more than 20 traders in the city using the word ""RAMAYAN"" as a mark for the similar products and also in different parts of the country.",1
9,"On a perusal of the artistic work said to have been created, there is no doubt that both the marks are identical in design, colour, scheme and the reproduction of photographs is in such a manner that an ordinary buyer would reasonably come to a mistaken conclusion that the article covered by one brand can be the article covered by the other.",1
9,Both the parties have claimed to be manufacturing units engaged in certain goods.,1
9,"Further, the respondent herein claimed that though he had been in the business since 1980, he had developed and published the artistic work in 1986 and has also been using the mark as a trademark and claiming use since 1986 whereas the appellant herein claimed use of the trademark since 1987.",1
9,"However, by filing an application to the concerned authority, the appellant has claimed the use since 1981.",1
9,"Further, in various pleadings in the Title Suits filed by the respondent herein, the appellant herein has admitted the use and publication of the artistic mark of the respondent before the date of claim of the first use by the appellant, that is, 1987.",1
9,"From these facts, it is clear that the respondent herein was using the artistic mark earlier in point of time to that of the appellant herein.",1
9,"In view of the foregoing discussion, we do not find any irregularity in the order passed by the Board dated 10.01.2005, consequently, the appeal fails and is accordingly dismissed.",4
9,"However, the parties are left to bear their own costs.",4
9,Appeal dismissed,4
10,These two Criminal Appeals are preferred by the accused against the judgment and order dated 22.3.2012 in Criminal Misc.,6
10,"Application no. 1295 of 2011 and 1296 of 2011 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court refusing to quash the complaint and the process issued under Section 63 of the Copyright Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred as ""the Copyright Act"") read with Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred as ""IPC"").",6
10,"The respondent no. 1 Shyam Vithalrao Devkatta, filed a complaint being Criminal Case no. SW/332 of 2011 under Section 63 of the Copyright Act, later amended to add additional charges under Sections 406 and 420 read with Section 34 of the IPC, against five persons.",6
10,Upon due verification process was issued by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate against all except the fifth accused.,6
10,"Of these accused, four approached the Bombay High Court by way of filing two criminal misc. applications, under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as ""Cr.P.C"") for quashing the complaint.",6
10,"The High Court having refused to quash the complaint, the appellants have approached this Court.",6
10,"The complainant/Respondent No.1 claims copyright in a synopsis of a story written by him with the title ""Desi Boys"".",6
10,"According to him, he had written a story with the title ""Desi Boys"" and had got the synopsis of the story registered with the Film Writers Association on 25.11.2008, when a friend, one Ramesh Bhatnagar, told him that a comedy film story is required by the son of a film Director, David Dhawan, he mailed the concept of the story in the form of a synopsis as an attachment to an email addressed to Ramesh Bhatnagar on 14.10.2009 with the words ""Dear Friend, just see the attachment."" Ramesh Bhatnagar forwarded the story, calling it ""just an idea"" by email to one Ahsan Sagar on 15.10.2009.",6
10,"What was forwarded was apparently the same short synopsis of the concept with the title ""Desi Boys"".",6
10,A copy on the record makes it clear that it was by no means the entire story with all the dialogues and the screen play.,6
10,"Having done so, his friend Ramesh Bhatnagar did not receive any reply but, suddenly the complainant saw the promos of a film bearing the title ""Desi Boys"", actually spelt as ""Desi Boyz"".",6
10,"According to him, the adoption of the title ""Desi Boyz"" is a clear infringement of the copyright in the film title ""Desi Boys"".",6
10,"Admittedly, he has not seen the film and he states in his complaint, he cannot say whether a part of the story of the film written by him has also been infringed.",6
10,"In the meanwhile, the appellants released their film with the title ""Desi Boyz"" throughout the world including India on 25.11.2011.",6
10,"According to them, the film is based on a story written by one Milap Zaveri, who wrote the story under an agreement dated 02.09.2009, for which they have paid the author by cheque.",6
10,The shooting of the film commenced on 07.11.2010 and the respondent no. 1 came to know about the film sometime on 12.10.2011.,6
10,The details of the defence are not dealt with here since the matter must be decided on the basis of the tenability of the complaint.,6
10,"The Court of Learned Metropolitan Magistrate having taken cognizance, as stated above the appellants approached the Bombay High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.",6
10,P.C for quashing the complaint and process issued under Section 63 of the Copyright Act read with Sections 406 and 420 of IPC.,6
10,"The learned Single Judge who heard the matter as a part of a batch of matters in which parties had challenged the order issuing process against them in several different cases, dismissed the applications.",3
10,"In paragraph 97 of the judgment, the High Court considered the appellants case and merely pointed out that according to the appellants, the story which they had converted into a film was written by an author to whom they had paid a certain amount under an agreement even before the complaint of the respondent no. 1 Devkatta.",6
10,"Thereupon, the High Court merely observed that the facts alleged by the respondent no. 1 can only be determined at the trial and on the face of the record there was neither any abuse of court nor failure of justice and the applications were simply dismissed.",3
10,"There is no decision on the various issues raised by the appellants, hence these appeals.",6
10,"Mr. Raju Ramchandran, the learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the respondent No.1 Devkatta has claimed infringement of copyright in the title of the synopsis of a story ""Desi Boys"".",2
10,"Mr. Ramchandran, maintains that there is no copyright in the title of a story or for that matter a film and therefore, no complaint is tenable under Section 63 of the Copyright Act which makes a deliberate infringement or the abatement of the copyright in a work punishable as an offence.",2
10,"According to the learned counsel, the appellants got the story written by an author who was paid for it and by now the story had been converted into a film bearing the title ""Desi Boyz"" starring Akshay Kumar, John Abraham, Deepika Padukone, Anupam Kher, etc.",2
10,"The film had been released all over the world including India on 25.11.2011, after theatrical trailers were released on two occasions.",6
10,"It was submitted that the story of the film released by the appellants bears no similarity whatsoever with the story of which Devkatta has written a synopsis, the characters and the scenes and the settings being entirely different.",2
10,"The main issue that arises for determination is whether the respondent No.1 Devkatta has copyright in the title ""Desi Boys"" which he has given to the synopsis of a story.",1
10,"Further, if at all a complaint under section 63 of the Copyright Act is tenable against all the appellants for giving the title ""Desi Boyz"" to the film released by them.",1
10,"Section 13 of the Copyright Act, lays down works in which copyright subsists.",0
10,Section 13(1) reads as follows:,0
10,"""13(1) Subject to the provisions of this section and the other provisions of this Act, copyright shall subsist throughout India in the following classes of works, this is to say,",0
10,"(a) original literary, dramatic, musical and artis tic works;",0
10,(b) cinematograph films; and,0
10,(c) [sound recording],0
10,"It is obvious that what is claimed by Respondent No.1 Devkatta is only copyright in the title ""Desi Boys"".",1
10,"It is, therefore, not necessary to examine if a mere synopsis or a note of a story amounts to a literary work.",1
10,"Admittedly, Devkatta has not made any film by the name ""Desi Boys"" and his only grievance is about the infringement of copyright in the title which according to him is the soul of his story and copying it takes away everything from his story.",1
10,"The question that arises is whether copyright exists in the title ""Desi Boys"".",1
10,A title of a work has been considered to be not fit to be the subject of copyright law as will be apparent from the cases considered later.,1
10,"A title by itself is in the nature of a name of a work and is not complete by itself, without the work.",1
10,No instance of a title having been held to be the subject of copyright has been pointed out to us.,1
10,"It must be noted that in India copyright is a statutory right recognized and protected by The Copyright Act, 1957.",1
10,"It must therefore be first seen if the title ""Desi Boys"" can be the subject of copyright.",1
10,"On a plain reading of Section 13, copyright subsists in inter alia an original literary work.",1
10,"In the first place a title does not qualify for being described as ""work"".",1
10,It is incomplete in itself and refers to the work that follows.,1
10,"Secondly, the combination of the two words ""Desi"" and ""Boys"" cannot be said to have anything original in it.",1
10,They are extremely common place words in India.,1
10,"It is obvious, therefore, that the title ""Desi Boys"", assuming it to be a work, has nothing original in it in the sense that its origin cannot be attributed to the respondent No.1.",1
10,In fact these words do not even qualify for being described as 'literary work'.,1
10,"The Oxford English Dictionary gives the meaning of the word 'literary' as ""concerning the writing, study, or content of literature, especially of the kind valued for quality of form"".",1
10,"The mere use of common words, such as those used here, cannot qualify for being described as 'literary'.",1
10,"In the present case, the title of a mere synopsis of a story is said to have been used for the title of a film.",1
10,"The title in question cannot therefore be considered to be a 'literary work' and, hence, no copyright can be said to subsist in it, vide Section 13; nor can a criminal complaint for infringement be said to be tenable on such basis.",1
10,The decisions cited on behalf of the appellants show that it is well settled that copyright does not subsist in a title of work.,1
10,"In Hogg vs Maxwell reported in (1866 67) L.R.2 Ch. App. 307, the question was whether the defendant had infringed the copyright of the plaintiff in the title of a monthly magazine called ""Belgravia"".",5
10,"Referring to the title ""Belgravia"" the Court observed:",5
10,"""It is quite absurd to suppose that the Legislature, in providing for the registration of that which was to be the indicium of something outside the registry, in the shape of a volume or part of a volume, meant that, by the registration of one word, copyright in that one word could be obtained, even although that one word should be registered as what was to be the title of a book or of a magazine. .",5
10,"I apprehend, indeed, that if it were necessary to decide the point, it must be held that there cannot be what is termed copyright in a single word, although the word should be used as a fitting title for a book.",5
10,"The copyright contemplated by the Act must be not in a single word, but in some words in the shape of a volume, or part of a volume, which is communicated to the public, by which the public are benefited, and in return for which a certain protection is given to the author of the work.",5
10,"All arguments, therefore, for the purpose of maintaining this bill on the ground of copyright appear to me to fall to the ground.""",5
10,"In Francis Day & Hunter Ltd. vs Twentieth Century Fox Corporation Ltd. and Ors. reported in AIR 1940 Privy Council 55 1939 Indlaw PC 11, the Privy Council considered the infringement of copyright in the title of a song by its adoption for the title of a film.",5
10,The Privy Council observed:,5
10,"""In the present case the title was originally applied to a musical composition, whereas it has been applied by the respondents to a motion picture or a film.",5
10,"The argument of the appellant company would be the same, it seems, if the application of the title complained of had been to a picture or a statue.",5
10,"On this reasoning it would be said that the title ""Adam"" applied to a work of statuary would be infringed if that title were used as that of a novel.",5
10,These and other anomalous consequences justify the broad principle that in general a title is not by itself a proper subject matter of copyright.,5
10,"As a rule a title does not involve literary composition, and is not sufficiently substantial to justify a claim to protection.",5
10,"That statement does not mean that in particular cases a title may not be on so extensive a scale, and of so important a character, as to be a proper subject of protection against being copied.",5
10,"As Jessel M.R. said in Dicks vs Yates (which, as Lindley L.J. said in Licensed Victuallers' Newspaper Co. vs Bingham, virtually overruled on this point Weldon vs Dicks) there might be copyright in a title ""as, for instance, in a whole page of title or something of that kind requiring invention."" But this could not be said of the facts in the present case.",5
10,"There may have been a certain amount, though not a high degree, of originality in thinking of the theme of the song, and even in choosing the title, though it is of the most obvious.",5
10,"To ""break the bank"" is a hackneyed expression, and Monte Carlo is, or was, the most obvious place at which that achievement or accident might take place.",5
10,"The theme of the film is different from that of the song, and their Lordships see no ground in copyright law to justify the appellants' claim to prevent the use by the respondents of these few obvious words, which are too unsubstantial to constitute an infringement, especially when used in so different a connection.""",5
10,That case is apposite in the sense that the title of a song was adopted as the title of a film like in the present case the title of the synopsis of a story has been adopted as a title of a film and not another story.,1
10,Moreover the title comprised of common words as in the present case and they were held that they were too unsubstantial to constitute an infringement.,1
10,"In E.M. Forster and Anr. vs A.N. Parasuram reported in AIR 1964 Madras 331 1964 Indlaw MAD 29481 the author of ""A passage to India"" E.M. Forster filed a suit against the defendants for alleged infringement of copyright in the title of the book for adopting as a title the name of the defendants guide written for students, as ""E M Forster, A Passage to India, Everyman's guide"".",5
10,"The Court reviewed the law on the subject, (i)Macmillan vs Suresh Chander Deb, ILR 17 Cat 951, (ii) Longman vs Winchester, (1809)16 Ves 269, (iii) Dicks vs Yates, (1881) 18 Ch D 79, and observed that there was no copyright in respect of title vide page 231 of the report.",5
10,Eventually the Court held :,5
10,"""As we have earlier affirmed, there is no copyright in the title and purchasers, whether of the original work or of the guide, are most unlikely to be illiterate, or unacquainted with English.",5
10,"It will be perfectly clear to them, from the words enclosed in brakets as a sub title, that they were acquiring, not the original work, but a ""guide for University students. .""",5
10,"The same question arose in Kanungo Media (P) Ltd. v RGV Film Factory & Ors. reported in (2007) ILR 1 Delhi 1122 where the Court declined injunction against the defendant for using the brand name and title ""Nishabd"" alleging similar to the film of the plaintiff therein.",5
10,"The learned Judge A.K. Sikri, J. (as His Lordship then was) referred to decisions of the American Courts and observed that the position is the same as under the copyright law in India:",5
10,"""12. .",5
10,"What, therefore, follows is that if a junior user uses the senior user's literary title as the title of a work that by itself does not infringe the copyright of a senior user's work since there is no copyright infringement merely from the identity or similarity of the titles alone.""",5
10,The Court then considered the question of protection of title as a trademark with which we are not concerned in this case.,1
10,"Subsequently, in R. Radha Krishnan vs Mr. A.R. Murugadoss & Ors. reported in 2013 5 L.W. 429, the Madras High Court followed the decision of the Delhi High Court in the Kanungo Media Case and rejected an injunction for restraining the defendant from using the title of the plaintiff's film 'Raja Rani'.",1
10,The Madras High Court considered various other decisions and held that the words 'Raja Rani' are words of common parlance which denote the king or the queen and cannot be protected under the law of copyright.,1
10,"The two judgments of the Madras High Court cited above and the judgment of the Delhi High Court in our view, lay down the correct law.",1
10,"The learned counsel for the appellants relied on passages from Copinger and Skone James on Copyright Sixteenth Edition by Kevin Garnett, M.A, Gillian Davies, D.L., Ph.D. and Gwilym Harbottle, B.A. (Oxon) at page 70:",1
10,"""Names and titles as literary works.",1
10,"In the same vein is the reluctance of English courts to confer copyright protection on titles of newspapers, magazines, books and the like.",1
10,"In relation to books in particular, the title normally forms part of a copyright work consisting of the book as a whole and the issue here may be whether the copying of the title amounts to the taking of a substantial part of the whole work.",1
10,"General statements can nevertheless be found in non copyright cases to the effect that there is no property in a name or title standing alone unless it is the subject of goodwill or a registered trade mark.""",1
10,The learned authors observed:,1
10,"""The courts, have, however, been careful not to rule out the possibility of such protection in appropriate circumstances, although in practice no case has ever gone this far.",1
10,"The only concrete example which has been given judicially is the now archaic practice of the title page of a book consisting of an extended passage of text.""",1
10,In relation to copyright in characters and titles the learned authors observed:,1
10,"""It is very difficult to protect titles of films by an action for infringement of copyright due to the requirements of originality and that a substantial part of a work be copied.",1
10,"If a well known title of a film is used without authority, the owner's remedy is likely to lie in passing off.",1
10,"Protection by registration as a trade mark may be available provided the title in sufficiently distinctive.""",1
10,"We are thus, of the view, that no copyright subsists in the title of a literary work and a plaintiff or a complainant is not entitled to relief on such basis except in an action for passing off or in respect of a registered trademark comprising such titles.",1
10,"This does not mean that in no case can a title be a proper subject of protection against being copied as held in Dicks v Yates where Jessel M.R said ""there might be copyright in a title as for instance a whole page of title or something of that kind requiring invention"" or as observed by Copinger (supra).",1
10,"In the present case we find that there is no copyright in the title ""Desi Boys"" and thus no question of its infringement arises.",1
10,The prosecution based on allegations of infringement of copyright in such a title is untenable.,1
10,The learned counsel for the respondents indeed contended that the applications under Section 482 were rightly dismissed since these facts alleged by the appellants depend on evidence at the trial.,2
10,"It is not possible to agree since it has throughout been the case of the respondent no. 1 Devkatta that he is claiming copyright only in the title of the synopsis of his story ""Desi Boys"" and he has not even seen the film of the appellants nor does he know the story.",1
10,The learned counsel for the respondent was however right in his submissions that it is not necessary to furnish all the ingredients of the complaint and failing which the complaint is liable to be dismissed on that ground.,1
10,It is not necessary to consider the decisions cited by the respondents on this point.,1
10,"In the result, both the Criminal Appeals are allowed.",4
10,"The Criminal Case no. SW/332 of 2011 pending before the Learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai is hereby quashed.",4
10,Appeals allowed,4
