4,The respondent No,6
4,"I was tried before the Court of Sessions, Visakhapatnam for offences under s. 120-B, Indian Penal Code, s. 409, s. 477-A",6
4,"and s. 471 read with s. 467, I.P.C",6
4,while respondent No. 2 was tried for an offence under s. 120-B and for offences under ss,6
4,"409 read with s. 109, 477-A and 471 read with s. 467, I.P.C",6
4,"Each of the respondents was convicted of the first two offences, but",6
4,the respondent No,6
4,I alone was convicted of the other two offences,6
4,"Various sentences were passed against them by the Additional Sessions judge, Visakhapatnam, who presided over the court",6
4,The respondents preferred appeals before the High Court challenging their convictions and sentences,6
4,"The State on the other hand preferred an application for revision under s. 439, Cr",6
4,P.C. for the enhancement of the sentences passed on the respondents,6
4,"The High Court allowed the two appeals, acquitted the respondents and dismissed the application for revision preferred by the State",6
4,The State of Andhra Pradesh has come up before this Court in appeal by obtaining special leave under Art,6
4,136 of the Constitution,6
4,The prosecution case in so far as it is material for the decision of this appeal is as follows,6
4,"In the year 1929 the Andhra Engineering Co., which was originally a partnership firm formed by one D.L.N. Raju was converted into a private limited, company with its headquarters at Visakhapatnam",6
4,We shall refer to this company throughout as the AECO,6
4,"It obtained licences from the Government under the Electricity Act for supply of electrical energy to Visakhapatnam, Anakapalli and some other places",6
4,"As the AECO did not have the necessary capital to undertake the work Raju floated in the year 1933 a public limited company called Visakhapatnam Electric Supply Corporation Ltd.,  and another in the year 1936 called the Anakapalli Electric Supply Corporation Ltd",6
4,The AECO transferred its licences for the supply of electrical energy to the consumers of Visakhapatnam to VESCO and similarly transferred to AECO the licence to supply electrical energy to consumers at Anakapalli,6
4,The AECO was appointed Managing Agent for each of these corporations under separate agreements,6
4,"Some time later other industrial concerns, the Andhra Cements Ltd., Vi jayawada and the East Coast Ceremics",6
4,Rajahmurthy were started apparently by Raju himself- and the AECO was appointed the Managing Agent of each of these concerns,6
4,"The original managing agency agreement in favour of AECO with respect to VESCO was for a period of 15 years i.e., from 1933 to 1948 and was later renewed for the remaining term of the currency of the licence granted by the Government under the Electricity Act",6
4,"A mention may be made of the fact that in June, 1952 the VESCO undertaking was acquired by the Government under the provisions of the ""'Electricity Undertaking Acquisition Act"" but nothing turns on it",6
4,The VESCO had its own Board of Directors while the AECO had also its own separate Board of Directors,6
4,The VESCO had no Managing Director but at each meeting of its Board of Directors one of the Directors used to be elected Chairman,6
4,The same practice was followed at the meeting of the general body of the shareholders,6
4,"The AECO on the other band always had a Managing Director, first of whom was D.L.N. Raju",6
4,"He died in the year 1939 and was succeeded by R.K.N.G. Raju, an Advocate of Rajahmundry",6
4,"This person, however, did not shift to Visakhapatnam on his becoming the Managing Director but continued to stay most of the time at Rajahmundry",6
4,According to the prosecution both these concerns were running smoothly and efficiently during the lifetime of D.L.N. Raju because he was personally attending to their affairs,2
4,"His successor, however, apart from the fact that be continued to be staying mostly at Rajahmundry, was also interested in several other ventures, including a sugar factory at Dewas in Central India",2
4,Eventually many of those ventures failed,2
4,According to the prosecution the second Raju was not bestowing sufficient care and attention on the affairs of VESCO,2
4,"The AECO as Managing Agents of VESCO had appointed in the year 1939 one D.V. Appala Raju, a trusted employee, as its representative and as the secretary of VESCO",6
4,In 1944 this person resigned from his appointments and started his own business in radio and electrical goods in the name of D. Brothers,6
4,"He was succeeded by T. Visweswara Rao, P.W. 6, an employee of the AECO",6
4,The respondent No. 1,1
4,"Ganeswara Rao was also an old employee of AECO, having been appointed a stenotypist in the year 1923 on an initial salary of Rs",1
4,p.m,1
4,Eventually he became the Head Clerk therein,1
4,He pressed his claim for appointment as Secretary of VESCO and representative of the Managing Agents at Visakhapatnam and R .H.G,1
4,Raju appointed him to that post,1
4,All this is not disputed,1
4,"The respondent No. 1, even after his appointment on two posts connected with VESCO, continued to work with the AECO also whose business had by then been confined only to that of Managing Agents of the four companies floated by D.L.N. Raju",1
4,"It is the prosecution case that as Secretary of VESCO and the resident representative of the Managing Agents, the respondent No",2
4,"I was attending to the day to day affairs of VESCO, which included the receiving of all sums of money due to VESCO, spending money for the purpose of VESCO attending to the appointment, supervision and control of the staff of VESCO, purchasing materials required for the purpose of VESCO and supervising over the accounts of VESCO",2
4,He was thus all important with respect to the every day affairs of VESCO,2
4,His dual capacity enabled the respondent No,2
4,I to earn the confidence not only of the Directors of AECO but also of those of VESCO,2
4,The accounts maintained by the VESCO used to be explained by him not only to the Directors but also to the shareholders,2
4,The knowledge of the Financial position of VESCO obtained by them used to be derived essentially from the respondent No. 1,2
4,"As Secretary of VESCO it was his duty to convene the meetings of the Board of Directors, to present before them the periodical statement of receipts and expenditure of VESCO, to convene meetings of the General Body, to prepare the Managing Agents' report and the Director's report as also to see to the presentation of auditors' report and the statement of accounts",2
4,The explanations of the Managing Agents and the Directors of VESCO with respect to the items mentioned in the orders of the Board used also to be placed by him before the shareholders,2
4,"It was also his duty to have the accounts of VESCO audited by the auditors elected by the general body and to produce before the auditors the relevant accounts, vouchers, bank statements and so on",2
4,There were no complaints about the management of the affairs of VESCO or the AECO till the end of 1946 or the beginning of 1947,2
4,"One significant fact, however, which occurred prior to 1946 - is referred to by the prosecution",2
4,"Till the -year 1945 Messrs C. P. Rao & Co., a firm of Chartered Accountants were the auditors of VESCO but after the respondent No",2
4,I became Secretary,2
4,"one B. Rajan was elected Auditor not only for VESCO but for all the other four concerns, including AECO",2
4,This person was Auditor for Greenlands Hotel at Visakhapatnam,2
4,of which the respondent No,2
4,I was a Director,2
4,"R.K.N.G. Raju took till towards the end of 1947 and died at Madras in April, 1948",2
4,"According to the prosecution the respondent No. I wanted to take advantage of this fact and conceived of a scheme for misappropriating as much money belonging to VESCO as possible before the managing agency agreement of AECO came to an end in October, 1948",2
4,"I secured the promotion of the approver K.V. Ramana, who was originally Accounts Clerk to the post of Senior Accountant",2
4,"Similarly K. V. Gopala Raju was transferred from the post of Stores Clerk to the general department and K.S.N. Murty, the discharged accused, was appointed Stores Clerk in his place",2
4,"Later, however, Murty was also got transferred to the general section and replaced by P. W. 18",2
4,Srinivasa Rao originally a stores boy,2
4,"The approver who was originally an Accounts clerk with the AECO was, it may be mentioned, appointed a cashier in VESCO in 1946 at the instance of the respondent No",2
4,I and was thus beholden to him,2
4,He was later promoted as Senior Accountant and in his place the respondent No. 2,2
4,Laksbminarayana Rao was appointed the Cashier,2
4,According to the prosecution the respondent No,2
4,"I took both the approver and Lakshminarayana Rao in his confidence as also some other persons ""known and unknown"" for carrying out his nefarious purpose, namely, the misappropriation of the funds of VESCO during the subsistence of AECO's managing agency of VESCO",2
4,The conspiracy is said to have been hatched in the year 1947 and falsification of accounts and misappropriation of funds of VESCO went on till the end of the accounting year,2
4,The term of the managing agency was renewed in 1943 and AECO con- tinued to be managing agents until the VESCO was taken over by the Government in 1952,2
4,I continued to be the Secretary of VESCO and resident representative of the Managing Agents throughout the period of conspiracy,2
4,"After the death of R.K.N.G. Raju, it was discovered that the AECO was indebted to many concerns which were under its managing agency, the liability being shown either as that of AECO or that of R.K.N.G. Raju personally",2
4,"Again, the VESCO was shown as indebted to the Andhra Cement, ; to the extent of Rs",2
4,"42, 000",2
4,"This amount was, however, paid by the AECO from the funds of VESCO",2
4,I and some of his friends were in search of a rich and substantial man who would be amenable to them to fill the post of Managing Director of AECO,2
4,"Eventually their choice fell on G. V. Subba Raju, P. W. 25, a resident of Manchili, who held a large number of shares in the AECO and who was, besides, related to R.K.N.G. Raju by marriage",6
4,It is said that this person has not received much education and knows only bow to sign his name in English,6
4,He was assured that by consenting to become the Managing Director be would not be required to discharge onerous duties and that the respondent No,6
4,I would look to all the affairs of VESCO,6
4,He was also told that apart from signing important papers which may be sent to him by the respondent No. I from time to time to Manchili or wherever be might be would have no work to do,6
4,He agreed and was elected Managing Director of AECO in the middle of 1948,6
4,Upon this understanding he accepted the position offered to him,6
4,"The VESCO used to receive large amounts of money from high tension power consumers such as the railways, K. G. Hospital, the Port Administration, the Andhra University etc",6
4,by cheques,6
4,But domestic consumers usually paid their bills in cash to the bill collectors who used to hand over their collections to the respondent No. 2,6
4,The respondent No. 2 was asked by the respondent No,6
4,I to maintain a private note book,6
4,"In ""that book payments which used to be made by respondent No. 2 on the basis of slips issued by the respondent No",6
4,I  used to be noted and the amount totalled up at the end of the day,6
4,"This amount was posted in VESCO's Cash Handover Book as ""'by safe"" indicating that this amount was kept in the safe, though in fact it was not",6
4,On the basis of the entries in the Handover Book the final accounts were written up,6
4,"I opened four personal accounts in different banks, including the Imperial Bank of India",6
4,When the respondent No,6
4,I had to issue a personal cheque on any of these Banks he used to ask the second respondent to send an equivalent amount to the Bank concerned for being credited to his account,6
4,These amounts also used to be noted in the private note book and entered,6
4,Another thing which the respondent No,6
4,"I initiated was opening a heading in the ledger called ""advance purchase of materials",6
4,Amounts which had been misappropriated used to be posted therein though in fact no orders were placed for any material,6
4,It may be mentioned that Subba Raju used to visit Visakhapatnam twice a month and check up the account books,6
4,At that time it used to be represented to him that the amounts which were shown to be in the safe and not found therein  had been sent to the Bank for being deposited,6
4,"Apparently Subba Raju was fully satisfied with this and other explanations and, therefore, he appointed one C. S. Raju, who was the Manager of Andhra Cements to supervise over the affairs of VESCO.Apparently because of this a new method of misappropriation was adopted by the respondents by starting in the VESCO account books, an account called ""suspense account",6
4,A lakh of rupees passed through that account,6
4,Amounts which were misappropriated used to find their way in this account,6
4,A new cash book was also said to have been prepared by the conspirators with the object of covering up the misappropriations which had been made,6
4,"Subba Raju was not satisfied with the nature of supervision exercised by C. S. Raju over the affairs of VESCO because he used to look only at the cash book entries of the days on which he paid visits to VESCO's office, to which he used to go with previous intimation",6
4,"Besides that, C. S. Raju's management of Andhra Cements had landed it into a loss of Rs",6
4,"30, 000",6
4,"Because of all these things he had C. S. Raju replaced towards the end of the year 1951 by one Subbaramayya, a retired Finance Officer from the Madras Electricity Board both as a Director of Andhra Cements and as a Supervisor over the accounts of VESCO",6
4,Subbaramayya took his work seriously and called for information on a number of points from the respondent No. 1,6
4,"He, however, was unable to obtain any information",6
4,"In January, 1952 he therefore brought one S. G. Krishna Aiyar who had vast experience in the maintenance of accounts of electrical undertaking's having been Chief Accountant of the South Madras Electric Supply Corporation, to undertake an investigation and then to act as Financial Adviser",6
4,"In the meantime on November 29, 1951 there was a meeting of the General Body at which the accounts were, among other things, to be considered",6
4,There was a considerable uproar at that meeting because the respondent No. 1 said that the Auditor's report had not been received,6
4,The shareholders felt that the report had been received but was being suppressed or deliberately withheld,6
4,"However, the meeting was postponed and eventually held on December 9, 1951",6
4,On that date the respondent No. 1 produced the auditor's report,6
4,According to the prosecution the report is a forged document,2
4,That was also the feeling-of a number of shareholders who wanted to see the original but one Dutt who was Chairman of the meeting after seeing Ex,6
4,P. 234 said that the report seemed to be a genuine one,6
4,"S. G. Krishna Aiyar after his appointment in January, 1952, made close enquiry and submitted an interim report",6
4,"That report showed that during the period 1948-49 Rs. 33, 271-10-0 shown as paid to the Andhra Power System were in fact not paid",6
4,The respondent No. 1 on being asked to explain said that he would give his explanation to the Managing Director,6
4,The Interim Report showed that there was a shortage of about Rs,6
4,"90, 000/- for this period",6
4,"On February 12, 1952 the respondent No",6
4,"I wrote to the Managing Director admitting his responsibility and agreed to make good the amounts found short or such other amounts as would be found short up to the end of March, 1952",6
4,"Further scrutiny of the accounts was being carried out by Krishna Aiyar and in his subsequent report he pointed out that Rs. 2, 38, 000/- which were shown as having been paid to the Andhra Power System had actually not been paid",6
4,"In fact in April, 1952 the Collector attached VESCO properties for realising this amount",6
4,"On April 30, 1952 the respondent No. 1, by selling some of his property, himself paid Rs. 50, 000/- to the Andhra Power System towards the sum due to it from VESCO and had promised to pay the balance shortly thereafter",6
4,He was given time for doing so but he failed to pay it,6
4,"The Directors of VESCO thereafter authorised K. S. Dutt, one of the Directors to lodge a complaint with the police which he accordingly lodged on May 19, 1952",6
4,On the next day the police placed an armed guard around the office of the respondent No,6
4,I and seized a number of papers,6
4,As a result of investigation they found that there was a total misappropriation of Rs,6
4,"3, 40, 000",6
4,"On May 13, 1954 a chargesheet was filed against the two respondents as well as Murti and the approver Ramana",6
4,"OD September 13, 1954 Ramana offered to make a full Confession to the Additional District Magistrate (Independent) who was empowered to grant pardon under s. 337 of i he Code of Criminal Procedure",6
4,"He, however, directed Ramana to make his confession before a SubMagistrate",6
4,"The latter accordingly made a confession on November 15, 1954 and on November 17, 1954 the Additional District Magistrate (Independent) granted him pardon and that is how he came to be examined as a witness in this case",6
4,"As already stated, the Additional Sessions judge convicted both the respondents, the respondent No",6
4,I in respect of each head of the offences with which he was charged and the respondent No. 2 in respect only of the offences of conspiracy and misappropriation,6
4,The High Court set aside the conviction of the respondents on a number of grounds,3
4,"In the first place according to the High Court, joint trial of two or more persons in respect of different offences cornmitted by each of them is illegal and that here as they were charged with having committed offences under s. 120-B, s. 409, s. 477-A and s. 476/467, I.P.C",3
4,they could not be tried jointly,3
4,According to it the provisions of s. 239 were of no avail,3
4,Next according to the High Court even if s. 239 is applicable its provisions are subject to those of s. 234 and as such the trial being for more than three offences was impermissible,3
4,Then according to the High Court offences under,3
4,s. 409 and s,3
4,471/467 are of different kinds and are not capable of joint commission,3
4,"Therefore, they could not be jointly tried",3
4,"Further, according to the High Court where a conspiracy has yielded its fruits the conspirators can be charged with the actual offences committed and not with conspiracy to commit those offences",3
4,"Charge of conspiracy, according to the High Court, can be validly made only when the prosecution establishes that every conspirator expected to receive a personal benefit from it and that the prosecution has not been able to establish that the respondent No. 2 or the approver evidently had any such expectations since they did not in fact receive any corresponding benefit",3
4,In so far as the respondent No. 2 is concerned the High Court has held that since he was charged with a specific offence under s.409 I.P.C. he could not be convicted of mere abetment of an offence,3
4,The approver's evidence was held by the High Court to be inadmissible because the pardon granted to him was illegal,3
4,The High Court has also held that his evidence is unreliable and further that the Additional Sessions judge was in error in allowing him to refresh his memory by referring to various documents in a manner not permitted by s. 159 of the Evidence Act,3
4,"The High Court has further stated that inadmissible evidence was taken on record by the Additional Sessions judge, namely, account books of Billimoria Brothers, maintained in Gujrati and further that the Additional Sessions judge was in error in allowing the prosecution to use those account books for establishing absence of entries with regard to certain payments alleged in the VESCO books to have been made to them",3
4,"Finally, the High Court held that the examination of the respondent under s. 342 of the Code was unfair for a number of reasons and that the Additional Sessions judge had failed to perform an important duty in that he did not call the attention of the respondents to the provisions of s. 342 which enable an accused person to give evidence in his own behalf",3
4,Mr,3
4,"Bhimasankaram, appearing for the two respondents, however, has not sought to support the judgment of the High Court on all these points",3
4,The points which he urged are briefly these: (1) That there was a misjoinder of charges and persons in that the various provisions of s. 239 were clubbed together and an omnibus charge of conspiracy was framed which on its face was one likely to embarrass the respondents and make their task of defending themselves difficult,2
4,The procedure adopted in the investiga- tion and committal stages was irregular,2
4,3) Irrelevant evidence was introduced and some evidence was introduced in a manner not authorised by the Evidence Act,2
4,"4) That the Court abused its powers under s.342, Cr",2
4,P.C. while conducting the examination of the respondents,2
4,"The evidence of the approver was inadmissible because the pardon granted to him was illegal, that, in any case, it is unreliable, was so found even by the Sessions judge and must, therefore, be rejected",2
4,If the evidence of the approver is left out the remaining evidence would be inadequate to sustain the prosecution case,2
4,We shall deal with Mr. Bhimasankaram's contentions in the order in which we have set them out,1
4,The first question for consideration is whether there was a misjoinder of parties and of persons,1
4,"The first charge is in respect of the conspiracy alleged to have been entered into by the two respondents, K. V. Ramana, the approver, and others ""known and unknown"" to commit criminal breach of trust of the funds of VESCO and, in order to screen its detection, to falsify the accounts of VESCO and to use forged documents as genuine",1
4,On the face of it this is a valid charge,1
4,But certain objections have been taken to it with which we will deal at the appropriate place,1
4,"The second charge is for an offence of criminal breach of trust punishable under s. 409 and the accusation therein is that the two respondents along with Ramana, misappropriated 69 items aggregating to a little over Rs",1
4,"3, 20, 000",1
4,"It is clear from the charge that some of the amounts were misappropriated between April, 1947 and March, 1950, some between April, 1947 and March, 1949, some between April, 1947 and March, 1951 and quite a large number between September, 1947 and March, 1950 and a still large number between April, 1951 and March, 1952",1
4,It is thus apparent that offences committed within a space of 12 months were tried along with offences committed beyond that period,1
4,"Unless, therefore, the provisions of s. 239 are applicable it would follow that there was a misjoinder of charges",1
4,"The third charge is that the two respondents, along with the approver",1
4,"Ramana made false entries on seven different dates in the account books between September 19, 1947 and March 18, 1952 and thus committed an offence under s. 477-A, I.P.C",1
4,"The fourth charge is that the two respondents, along with the approver",1
4,"Ramana forged six documents on different dates between March 28, 1949 and November 12, 1951 and thus committed an offence under s. 471 read with s. 467, I.P.C",1
4,As we have pointed out earlier the respondent No,1
4,I alone was convicted by the Additional Sessions judge in respect of the third and fourth charges,1
4,Mr. Bhimasankaram supports the reason given by the High Court for coming to the conclusion that there was a misjoinder of charges,1
4,The main reasons upon which the conclusion of the High Court is based are firstly that there could be no clubbing together of the provisions of the various clauses of s. 239 and secondly that the respondents were charged with more than three offences of the same kind and that this was in contravention of s. 239 (c,1
4,In coming to the conclusion that the provisions of various clauses of s. 239 cannot be applied cumulatively the High Court has relied upon the decision in Re: Vankavalapati Gopala Rao 1956 AIR(Andhra) 21,5
4,"There the learned judges have held thus: ""These clauses are mutually exclusive and they cannot be simultaneously applied and to construe them as supplementing each other would be enlarging the scope of the exceptions",5
4,"Each clause is an exception to the general rule enacted in s. 233, Cr",5
4,P.C,1
4,"If such a combination is permissible, all persons accused of offences described in cls",5
4,a) to (g) can be tried together in one case which certainly involves a bewildering multiplicity of charges and which would obviously set at naught the salutary principle contained in s. 233,5
4,"The chapter is split up into two sub-heads, '-Form of charges""and"" Joinder of charges",0
4,Ss,0
4,221 to 232 are comprised under the first sub-head and ss,0
4,233 to 240 in the second,0
4,221 to 223 deal with the framing and content of charge,0
4,s. 224 deals with the interpretation of the language of the charge and s. 225 with the effect of errors in the charge,0
4,226 to 231 deal with the power of the court with regard to framing and altering charges and the procedure to be adopted at the trial where a charge is found to be defective or there is no charge or where a new charge is to be framed,0
4,S. 232 deals with the power of the. appellate court or the High Court when it discovers that there is material error in the charge,0
4,Then we come to the other sub-head of this chapter,0
4,S. 233 provides that for every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a. separate charge,0
4,It thus lays down the normal rule to be followed in every case,0
4,But it also provides that this will be subject to the exceptions contained in SS,0
4,"234, 235, 236 and 239",0
4,The first three provisions relate to the framing of charges against a single accused person,0
4,S. 234,0
4,1) deals with the trial of a person for offences of the same kind not exceeding three committed within the space of 12 months from the first to the last of such offences and s. 231 (2) what is meant by the expression 'offences of' the same kind,0
4,This provision lifts partially the ban on the trial of a person for more than one offence at the same trial,0
4,"S. 235(1), however, goes a step further and permits the trial of a person for more offences than one if they are so connected together as to form the same transaction",0
4,Thus under this provision if the connection between the various offences is established the limitations placed by s. 234(1) both as regards the number and the period during which the offences are alleged to have been committed will not apply,0
4,Full effect cannot possibly be given to this provision if we hold that it is subject to the limitation of s.234(1,0
4,Sub-s,0
4,"2) of S. 235 deals with a case where an offence falls within two definitions and sub-s.(3) deals with a case in which a number of acts are alleged against an accused person, different com- binations of which may constitute different offences",0
4,"Then we come to s. 236 which provides that if a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences and further provides that any number of such charges may be tried together",0
4,It also permits that charges could be framed against an accused person in the alternative if the court thinks fit,0
4,"Thus, this is a special provision available in case of doubt and is neither subject to the limitations prescribed by s. 233 nor those of the other preceding provisions",1
4,"Now, if the respondent No. 1 were alone tried upon the second, third and the fourth charges the provisions of s. 235(1) could have been pressed in aid if the allegations were that the offences were so connected together as to form one and the same transaction and the validity of the trial would not have been open to any attack",1
4,Similarly if the second respondent were alone tried on the second charge his trial would not have been open to any objection if the allegation were that the offences were so connected together as to form the same transaction,1
4,"Here, however, we have a case where the prosecution alleges that there was additionally a conspiracy to which apart from the two respondents the approver and some other persons were parties and where in both the respondents were tried together",1
4,"A conspiracy must be regarded as one transaction and, there- fore, a single individual charged with it could be tried with the aid of s. 235(1) for all the acts committed by him in furtherance or in pursuance of the conspiracy without the limitations imposed by s.234(1",1
4,"For, where all the acts are referable to the same conspiracy their connection with one another is obvious",1
4,The only provision in the Code which permits the joint trial of more than one person is s. 239 and what we have to see is whether under that provision the two respondents could have been jointly tried for the offences with which they were charged,1
4,"Let us, therefore, examine closely the provisions of s. 239",1
4,"It will be useful to set out the provisions of that section which run thus :"" ""This first thing to be noticed is that s. 239 does not read as if its various clauses can be applied only alternatively",0
4,On the other hand at the end of cl,0
4,f) there is a conjunction 'and,0
4,"If the intention of the Legislature was that the provisions of these clauses should be available only alternatively it would have used the word ""or"" and not ""and"" which has the opposite effect",0
4,"Grammatically, therefore, it would appear that the provisions of the various clauses are capable of being applied cumulatively",0
4,"The opening words of the section show that it is an enabling provision and, therefore, the Court has a discretion to avail itself cumulatively of two or more clauses",0
4,Of course a Court has the power to depart from the grammatical construction if it finds that strict adherence to the grammatical construction will defeat the object the Legislature had in view,0
4,"The concluding portion of s. 239 shows that the provisions contained in the former part of Chapter XIX shall, as far as may be, apply to the charges framed with the aid of s. 239",0
4,"Does this mean that the provisions of s. 233, 234, 235, and 236 must also be complied with",0
4,"Obviously, s. 233 does not override the provisions of s. 239",0
4,S. 234 cannot also be regarded as an overriding provision because reading it that way will lead to the clear result that whereas several accused persons can be charged at the same trial with any number of different offences committed by them in the course of the same transaction they cannot be tried also for -offences of the same kind exceeding three in number and committed beyond a space of 12 months from the first to the last,0
4,It could not have been the intention of the Legislature to create such a situation,0
4,"Again, as already stated, s. 234(1) does not override the provisions of s. 235(1) which permits trial of a person for more offences than one committed during any period provided they are so connected together as to form one transaction",0
4,"Unless we read s. 234(1) as not enacting a fetter on s. 235(1), it may not be possible to give full effect to the latter",0
4,"Now, since s. 234(1) cannot be properly read a, , ; overriding s. 235(1) there is no valid reason for construing it as overriding the provisions of s. 239 either",0
4,There are also other reasons which point to this conclusion which we will set out while considering the argument advanced by Mr. Bhimasankaram,0
4,"Bhimasankaram contended that s, 239 must be read at least subject to ss",0
4,234(1) and 235(1) on the ground,0
4,that if there are certain restrictions with respect to the trial of a single accused there is no reason why those restrictions will disappear if an accused person is tried along with several other persons,0
4,"Thus he points out that where several persons are accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed by them jointly within a period of 12 months, the number of offences for which they could be tried cannot exceed three",0
4,"In this connection he relied upon the words ""within the meaning of s. 224"" occurring in cl",0
4,c) of s. 239,0
4,"These words, he contended, clearly show that cl",0
4,c) of s. 239 is subject to the provisions of s. 234,0
4,"In our opinion the words ""within the meaning of s. 234"" indicate that what was meant by the words offence of the same kind"" ""'persons accused of more offences than one of the same kind not exceeding three in number""or may have used the words"" person accused of more than one offence of the same kind to the extent permissible under s. 234",0
4,"Therefore, even if the expression ""'same transaction"" alone had been used in s. 235(1) it would have meant a transaction consisting either of a single act or of a series of connec- ted acts",1
4,"The expression ""same transaction"" occurring in cls",1
4,"a), (c) and (d) of s. 239 as well as that occurring in s. 235(1) ought to be given the same meaning according to the normal rule of construction of statutes",1
4,"Looking at the matter in that way, it is pointless to inquire further whether the provisions of s. 239 are subject to those of s. 236(1",1
4,The provisions of sub-s,1
4,2) and (3) of s. 235 are enabling provisions and quite plainly can have no overriding effect,1
4,But it would be open to the court to resort to those provisions even in the case of a joint trial of several persons permissible under s,1
4,239.S. 236,1
4,is also an enabling provision to be availed of in case of doubt and it is meaningless to say that s. 239 is subject to s. 236,1
4,"Bearing in mind the fact that the provisions in the ""former part"" of Chapter XIX are applicable to charges made with the aid of s. 239 only ""so far as may be"" it would not be right to construe s. 239 as being subject to the provisions of ss",1
4,233 to 236,1
4,"It was contended by Mr. Chari that the expression ""former part"" would apply to the first sub- division of chapter XIX which deals with the form and content of the charges and the powers of the court with regard to the absence of charge and alteration of charge",1
4,"We cannot, however, give the expression such a restricted meaning",1
4,"For, even in the absence of those words, the earlier provisions could not have been ignored",1
4,"For, it is a rule of construction that all the provisions of a statute are to be read together and given effect to and that it is, therefore, the duty of the Court to construe a statute harmoniously",1
4,"Thus, while it is clear that the sections preceding s. 239 have no overriding effect on that section, , the courts are not to ignore them but apply such of them as can be applied without detracting from the provisions of S.239",1
4,"Indeed, the very expression 'so far as may be' empha- sises the fact that while the earlier provisions have to be borne in mind by the Court while applying s. 239 it is not those provisions but the latter which is to have an overriding effect",1
4,"Apart from this, the question whether the provisions of ss",1
4,233 to 236 have or have no overriding effect on s. 239,1
4,"is not strictly germane to the question considered by the High Court that is, clubbing together all the provisions of the various clauses of s. 239",1
4,Whether they can or cannot be read cumulatively must be determined by consideration of the language used in those clauses,1
4,We have already indicated how those clauses may be grammatically read,1
4,"On a plain construction of the provisions of s. 239, therefore, it is open to the Court to avail itself cumulatively of the provisions of the different clauses of s. 239 for the purpose of framing charges and charges so framed by it will not be in violation of the law, the provisions of ss",1
4,"233, 234 and 235 notwithstanding",1
4,"The decision of the Allahabad High Court in T. R. Mukherji's case (IL), is directly in point and is clearly to the effect that the different clauses of s. 239 are mutually exclusive in the sense that it is not possible to combine the provisions of two or more clauses in any one case and to try jointly several persons partly by applying the provisions of one clause and partly by applying those of another or other clauses",1
4,A large number of decisions of the different High Courts and one of the Privy Council have been considered in this case,1
4,"No doubt, as has been rightly pointed out in this case, separate trial is the normal rule and joint trial is an exception",1
4,"But while this principle is easy to appreciate and follow where one person alone is the accused and the interaction or intervention of the acts of more persons than one does not come in, it would, where the same act is committed by several persons, be not only inconvenient but injudicious to try all the several persons separately",1
4,This would lead to unnecessary multiplicity of trials involving avoidable inconvenience to the witnesses and avoidable expenditure of public time and money,1
4,No corresponding advantage can be gained by the accused persons by following the procedure of separate trials,1
4,"Where, however, several offences are alleged to have been committed by several accused persons it may be more reasonable to follow the normal rule of separate trials",1
4,"But here, again, if those offences are alleged not to be wholly unconnected but as forming part of the same transaction the only consideration that will justify separate trials would be the embarrassment or difficulty caused to the accused persons in defending themselves",1
4,We entirely agree with the High Court that joint trial should be founded on some 'principle,1
4,"But we find it difficult to appreciate what seems to be the view of the High Court that because each `clause of s. 239 enunciates a separate principle those principles are, so to speak, mutually' exclusive and cannot be cumulatively resorted to for trying several persons jointly in respect of several offences even though they form part of the same transaction",1
4,"The High Court has propounded that the connection described in each of the various clauses is mutually exclusive, that no two of them can exist simulta- neously in any case and that one cannot, therefore, have in any case persons connected with one another in two or more ways",1
4,"In other words, as the High Court puts it, persons included in two or more of the groups cannot all be tried together and that since there is absolutely nothing to connect one group with any other, the persons of one group cannot be tried with those of any other",1
4,No reason has been stated in support of this view,0
4,Let us consider whether there is anything intrinsically incompatible in combining two clauses of s. 239,0
4,Take cls,0
4,a) and (b,0
4,Cl,1
4,a) says that persons accused of the same offence committed in the course of the same transaction may be charged and tried together,0
4,"b) says that persons accused of an offence and persons accused of abetment, or, of an attempt to commit such offence may also be charged and tried together",0
4,"Now, if persons A, B and C are tried for an offence of murder what intrinsic difficulty would there be in trying X, Y and Z of abetment of the same offence",1
4,"The transaction in which all of them have participated is the same and the abetment by X, Y and Z of the offence committed by A, B and C would itself establish the connection of their acts with those of X, Y and Z",1
4,"Next, let us take cls",1
4,a) and (c,1
4,c) provides that persons accused of more than one offence of the same kind within the meaning of s. 234 committed by them jointly within the period of twelve months could also be charged and tried together,1
4,Let us consider these clauses along with another illustration,1
4,Two persons A and B enter a house at night and first together commit the murder of a man sleeping there and then also his wife,1
4,Each of them has committed two offences and each of them participated in the same offence,1
4,Why can they not be tried jointly for both murders and why should there be two trials for the two murders,1
4,The offences are of the same kind and must be deemed to have been committed in the course of the same transaction because of association and mutual connection,1
4,"Now, supposing in the illustration given A killed the man and B killed his wife",1
4,Under cl,1
4,c) they could be tried together because the offences are of the same kind,1
4,It would be ridiculous to say that they cannot be tried together for jointly committing the murder of the man and the wife because cl,1
4,a) and (c) cannot be combined,1
4,"For, without combining these two clauses their joint trial for the two offences in each of which both have participated would be impermissible",1
4,Then take s. (a) and (d,1
4,d) persons accused of different offences committed in the course of the same transaction can be tried together,1
4,Let us suppose that a group of persons are accused of having been members of an unlawful assembly the common object of which was to overawe by sheer force another group of persons and take forcible possession of a piece of land,1
4,Some of the members of the unlawful assembly carried axes with them while some others carried lathis and attacked the other group,1
4,"During the course of the attack one person from the second group was killed, as a rest of blows with an axe inflicted by the aggressors A, B and C. Two persons of the second group sustained grievous hurt as a result of lathi blows and one person sustained simple hurt",1
4,"Let us say that the grievous hurt was caused as a result of lathi blows given by X and Y, simple hurt was caused by lathi blows given by Z",1
4,"Here, the offences committed were those under ss",1
4,"147, 302, 325 and 323, I.P.C",1
4,"The offences being different and the persons commiting the offences being different, they could not be tried jointly only with the help of cl",1
4,a) of s. 239,1
4,"Nor again, could they be tried jointly only with the help of cl",1
4,d,1
4,Yet the transaction in which the offences were committed is the same and there is a close association amongst the persons who have committed the different offences,1
4,What intrinsic difficulty is there in trying them all together simultaneously availing of cls,1
4,a) and (d) of s. 239,1
4,These are enabling provisions which circumstance implies that the court may avail itself of one or more of these provisions unless doing so would amount to an infringement of any of the provisions of the Code,1
4,All these persons can be jointly tried for offences under s. 147 by recourse to cl,1
4,a,1
4,"So also A, B and C could be jointly tried together for an offences under s. 302",1
4,X and Y can be charged not only with offences under ss,1
4,"147 and 325, I. P.C. but also under s",1
4,302 read with s. 149,1
4,Similarly Z can be charged with offence's under ss,1
4,"147, 323 and offences under s. 302",1
4,read with s. 149 and s. 325,1
4,read with s. 149,1
4,The same offence committed by all of them is that under s. 147 and all of them can be tried jointly in respect of that offence under cl,1
4,"Similarly, if we take cl",1
4,d) by itself all of them can be tried jointly for the different offences committed by each of them in the course of the same transaction and if cl,1
4,a) is unavailable they could not be tried for the offence under s. 147 at the same trial,1
4,This means that the trial for an offence under s. 147 will have to be separated from the trial for the different offences committed by them,1
4,It is difficult to appreciate what purpose would be served by separating the trial for the same offence from the trial for different offences,1
4,"To repeat, the object of the legislature in enacting s. 239, Cr",1
4,P.C. clearly was to prevent multiplicity of trials and not only would that object be defeated but an extraordinary result will ensue if the various clauses of s. 239 are read disjunctively,1
4,"The reasons given by the Allahabad High Court, therefore, do not merit acceptance",1
4,The decision in Singarachariar's Case 1934 Indlaw MAD 352,1
4,"C.), has really no bearing upon the point before us",1
4,What was held there was that ss,1
4,235 (1) and s. 236 are mutually exclusive and if a case is covered by one of them it cannot be covered by the other,1
4,"In that case the question was whether a person who was first tried for an offence under s. 380, I.P.C. for stealing a blank second class railway ticket from the booking office, tried, for it and acquitted, could not be tried subsequently for the offence of forgery by making entries in that ticket and using it",1
4,"The acquittal in the previous case was urged as a bar under s. 403(1) of the Code to the trial for an offence under s. 467, I.P.C",1
4,"The contention apparently was that this was a case which fell under s. 236, Cr",1
4,"P.C. and that if he had been tried alternatively for both the offences at the same trial the Court could have dealt with him under s. 237, Cr",1
4,"The High Court, however, held that to be a kind of case which fell under s. 235(1) of the Code and that since that was so, the provisions of s. 236 were excluded",1
4,It is difficult to appreciate how this case assists the conclusion arrived at by the High Court,1
4,"In D.K. Chandra's Case 1951 Indlaw MUM 117, F. B) it was held that the provisions of ss",1
4,"234, 235 and 236",1
4,being exceptions to s. 233 must be strictly construed and that if joinder of charges did not fall under any of them it would be illegal and contrary to law,1
4,"The precise point which we have to consider here did not fall for consideration in that case i.e., whether the provisions of the various clauses of s. 239 could be used together or not",1
4,"This decision is, therefore, of little assistance",1
4,"On the other band there is the decision of this Court in The State of Andhra Pradesh v. Kandinmlla Subbaiah , which is to the effect that where several persons had committed offences in the course of the same transactions, they could jointly be tried in respect of all those offences under s. 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the limitation placed by s. 234 of the Code could not come into operation",1
4,"There, nine persons were jointly tried for 'an offence under s. 5 (1) (c) and (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, and s. 109, I. P. C. read with s' 420, s. 466 and s. 467, I. P. C. and all except one for offences under ss",1
4,"420, 467/471, I.P.C",1
4,Some of them were also charged with separate offences under some of these provisions,1
4,Two of the accused persons preferred a revision application before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in which they challenged the charges framed against them,1
4,The High Court allowed the revision application,1
4,"But on appeal by the State of Andhra Pradesh to this Court, this Court held that there was no misjoinder of charges, that the introduction of a large number of charges, spread over a long period was a question of propriety and that it should be left to the judge or the Magistrate trying the case to adopt the course which he thought to be appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case",1
4,In so far as some of the charges were concerned this Court pointed out that the Special judge who was to try the case should consider splitting them up so that the accused persons would not be prejudiced in answering the charges and defending themselves,1
4,It is true that the question of reading the various clauses cumulatively did not specifically arise for decision in that case but the High Court had held that the first charge was an omnibus charge containing as many as 203 offences and that it was in direct violation of ss,1
4,"234, 235 and 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure",1
4,"Dealing with this matter this Court held at p. 200 : ""No doubt, sub-s",3
4,1) of s. 234 provides that not more than three offences of the same kind committed by an accused person within the space of 12 months can be tried at the same trial,3
4,"But then s. 235 (1) provides that if in any one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence",3
4,"Therefore, where the alleged offences have been committed in the course of the same transaction the limitation placed by s. 234 (1) cannot operate",3
4,"No doubt, the offence mentioned in charge No",3
4,I is alleged to have been committed not by just one person but by all the accused and the question is whether all these persons can be jointly tried in respect of all these offences,3
4,To this kind of charges,3
4,239 would apply,3
4,"This section provides that the following persons may be charged and tried together, namely : (1) persons accused of the same offence committed in the course of the same transaction; (2) persons accused of abetment or an attempt to commit such an offence; (3) persons accused of different offences committed in the course of the same transaction",3
4,"Clearly, therefore, all the accused persons could be tried together in respect of all the offences now comprised in charge No. 1",3
4,This Court has thus clearly read the provisions of the various clauses cumulatively and we see no reason to read them differently,3
4,There remains the decision of this Court in K.V. Krishna Murthy Iyer v. The State of Madras (IN on which Mr. Bhimasankaram strongly relied,3
4,In that case this Court upheld the order of the High Court of Madras in quashing the charges in the exercise of its inherent powers even before the conclusion of the trial,3
4,"It is true that there the charges were 67 in number and spread over a long period, of time",3
4,That again was a matter which came before the High Court before conviction and not after the trial was over,3
4,"When an objection is taken at an early stage, there is time enough to rectify an error",3
4,But in the case before us no objection was taken to multiplicity or misjoinder of charges before the learned Additional Sessions judge and it was only in the High Court that the point was raised,3
4,"In such circumstances what the Court has to consider is whether prejudice has in fact been caused to the accused by reason of the multiplicity of charges or misjoinder, if any, of the charges",3
4,This is quite clear from the provisions of s. 537 of the Code as amended by Act 26 of 1955,3
4,"In Willie (William) Slaney v. The State of Madhya Pradesh , all the learned judges were in agreement on the point that this section and s. 535 cover every case in which there is departure from the rules set out in Ch",3
4,"XIX ranging from error, omissions and irregularities in charges that are framed, down to charges that might have been framed and were not and include a total omission to frame a charge at all at any stage of the trial",3
4,"The whole question has again been examined by this Court recently in Birichh Bhuian v. The State of Bihar Subba Rao J., who delivered the judgment of the Court has stated the position thus ""Even if we were to assume that there has been a misjoinder of charges in violation of the provisions of ss",3
4,"233 to 239 of the Code, the High Court was incompetent to set aside the conviction of the respondents without coming to the definite conclusion that misjoinder had occasioned failure of justice",3
4,This decision completely meets the argument based upon Dawson's Case,3
4,Merely because the accused persons are charged with a large number of offences and convicted at the trial the conviction cannot be set aside by the appellate court unless it in fact came to the conclusion that the accused persons were embarrassed in their defence with the result that there was a failure of injustice,3
4,For all these reasons we cannot accept the argument of learned counsel on the ground of misjoinder of charges and multiplicity of charges,3
4,"Bhimasankaram, supporting the view taken by the High Court then contends that it is not permissible to frame a charge of conspiracy when the matter has proceeded beyond the stage of conspiracy and that in pursuance of it offences have actually been committed",3
4,"A similar view was expressed by the same High Court in the case which was reversed by this Court in The State of Andhra Pradesh V. Kandinalla Subbaiah ( 1962 (2) SCR 194, ), and it was held that conspiracy to commit an offence being itself an offence a person can be separately charged with respect to such a conspiracy",3
4,Then this Court has observed,3
4,This decision is sufficient to dispose of the point under consideration,1
4,"In Swamirathnam's case (1), which is a decision of this Court certain persons were tried for the offence of the conspiracy to cheat the members of the public and for specific offences of cheating in pursuance of that conspiracy",5
4,It was urged before this Court that there was misjoinder of charges and persons,5
4,Negativing the contention,5
4,"this Court held that the charge as framed disclosed a single conspiracy although spread over several years, that there was one object of the conspiracy and that was to cheat the members of the public, that the fact that in the course of years other joined the conspiracy or that several incidents of cheating took place in pursuance of the conspiracy did not have the effect of splitting the conspiracy into several conspiracies",5
4,"that the several instances of cheating being alleged to be in pursuance of that conspiracy were parts of the same transaction and, therefore, the joint trial of the accused persons for the different offences was not vitiated",5
4,"No doubt, there is no discussion there as to the question whether the various clauses of s. 239 could be combined or as to the impact of the provisions of S. 233 to 236 on those of s. 239",1
4,"The actual decision of the case is, however, directly opposed to the contention now put forward before us",1
4,This decision has been followed in Natwarlal Sakarlal,1
4,Mody v. The State of Bombay,1
4,Crl. A,1
4,"No. III of 1959 decided on January 19, 1961",1
4,"In that case the impact of s. 120-B, I.P.C. on ss",1
4,233 and 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was considered by this Court and this Court observed,1
4,"Here again, the question of clubbing together of the various provisions of cls",2
4,a) to (d) of s. 239 was not raised expressly in the argument before the Court,2
4,But the ultimate decision of the case would negative such argument,2
4,"Mr. Bhimasankaram then relying upon the decision in R. v. Dawson ( [1960] 2 W.L.R. 435, contended that in any event it was not desirable to try the respondents at the same trial for as many as 83 offences and pointed out that these observations had received the approval of this Court in The State of Andhra Pradesh v. Kandimalla Subbaiah ([1962] 2 B. C.R. 194",2
4,In the first place there the trial had not actually begun,2
4,"Again, what was said by this Court was that it is undesirable to complicate a trial by introducing a large number of charges spread over a long period but even so this was a question of propriety which should be left to the discretion of the judge or Magistrate trying the case",2
4,Objection was taken very seriously by Mr. Bhimasankaram to the charge of conspiracy framed in this case,2
4,"That charge reads thus :"" ""Adverting to the portion which we have bracketed, his first objection was that the charge comprises within it not merely the conspiracy but also what was in fact done in pursuance of the conspiracy",2
4,His next objection was that it brought within its purview all the various offences which were alleged to have been committed by the respondents,2
4,The third objection was that no charge of conspiracy could have been framed after the conspiracy had borne its fruits,2
4,The last objection was that the charge of conspiracy was added to the charge sheet very late,2
4,We shall first deal with the third point,2
4,The offence of conspiracy is an entirely independent offence and though other offences are committed in pursuance of the conspiracy the liability of the conspirators for the conspiracy itself cannot disappear,2
4,"In the Indian Penal Code, as originally enacted, conspiracy was not an offence",2
4,"S. 120 -B which makes criminal conspiracy punishable was added by the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1913 (8 of 1913) along with s. 120-A. Section 120-A defines conspiracy and s. 120- B provides for the punishment for the offence of conspiracy",2
4,Criminal conspiracy as defined in s. 120-A and consists of an agreement to do an illegal act or an agreement to do an act which is not illegal by illegal means,1
4,"S. 120 B provides that whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards shall be punishable in the same manner as if he has abetted such offence unless there was an express provision in the Code for the punishment of such conspiracy",1
4,"Criminal conspiracy was, however, not an unknown thing before the amendment of the Indian Penal Code in 1913",1
4,But what the amendment did was to make that conspiracy itself punishable,1
4,"The idea was to prevent the commission of crimes by, so to , speak, nipping them in the bud",1
4,But it does not follow that where crimes have been committed the liability to punishment already incurred under s. 120-B by having entered into a criminal conspiracy is thereby wiped away,1
4,"No doubt, as already stated, where offences for committing which a conspiracy was entered into have actually been committed it may not, in the particular circumstances of a case, be desirable to charge the offender both with the conspiracy and the offences committed in pursuance of that conspiracy",1
4,But that would be a matter ultimately within the discretion of the court before which the trial takes place,1
4,"In so far as the fourth point is concerned, that would have a bearing not on the form of the charge but on the credibility of the evidence bearing on the point of conspiracy",1
4,As we are remanding the appeal to the High Court for a fresh decision after full consideration of the evidence adduced in the case it would be open to it to consider this matter particularly while judging the credibility of the-evidence of the approver,1
4,In so far as the portion included in the bracket is concerned we agree with the learned counsel that it should not have found place there,1
4,"The ideas, however, of the committing magistrate in stating all that is said there appears to have been merely to describe the conspiracy and do nothing more",1
4,"We do not think that either that or the other objection raised, that is, that the charge embraces within it all the offences said to have been committed by the respondents can properly",1
4,be said to vitiate the charge,1
4,The object in saying what has been set out in the first charge was only to give notice to the respondents as to the ambit of the conspiracy to which they will have to answer and nothing more,1
4,"Even assuming for a moment that this charge is cumbersome in the absence of any objection by the respondents at the proper time and in the absence of any material from which we could infer prejudice, they are precluded by the provisions of s. 225 from complaining about it at any rate after their conviction by the trial court",1
4,Coming to the next point of Mr,1
4,Bhimsankaram regarding the abuse of powers under s. 342 his first contention was that long and involved questions were put to the respondents,1
4,His second contention was that reference was made to a number of documents in some of these questions and those documents were not made available to the respondents for answering those questions,2
4,"The third contention was that the questions were involved, confusing and bordered on cross-examination",2
4,"Finally he said that the court did not perform its duty under s. 342 (4) of the Code as amended as it failed to bring to the notice of the respondents that they may, if they chose, give evidence in their defence",2
4,In support of his first contention he referred to questions Nos,2
4,"4, 8, 9, 10 and 20 put to the respondent No",2
4,I and question No. 12 put to the respondent No. 2 and tried to show that those questions rolled up a large number of separate questions and that it could not have been possible for the respondents to give any rational answers to those questions,2
4,We have read the questions and so also the answers,2
4,"While we are disposed to agree with learned counsel that the questions embrace a number of matters and that it would have been better if those matters had been made the subjects of separate questions, the answers given by the respondents clearly show that they understood the questions and wherever possible they have given complete answers to those questions",2
4,"That is to say, they have given their explantion regarding the circumstances appearing in the evidence set out in the questions and wherever that was not feasible they have said that they would do so in their written statements",2
4,In fact written statements have been filed by each of them in which every point left over has been fully answered,1
4,"We are informed that the questions had been prepared before hand by the learned Additional Sessions judge, copies thereof were made available to each of the respondents and it was with reference to those copies that they gave their answers in the court",1
4,A pointed reference was made to question,1
4,No. 20 put to respondent,1
4,No,1
4,I which contains as many as 22 sub-heads and it is said that it was an extremely unfair and embarrassing question,1
4,What the learned Additional Sessions judge has done is to err on the side of over-cautiousness by putting every circumstance appearing in the evidence to the respondents for eliciting their explanations,1
4,His object was to obviate the possibility of a complaint before the appellate court that they were denied the opportunity of explaining the circumstances appearing in evidence against them because of defective questions,1
4,"Nor again, do we think that there is any substance in the complaint made that the respondents had no opportunity of referring to the documents to which reference has been made in certain questions",1
4,No objection was taken on their behalf before the learned Additional Sessions judge and from the manner in which they have answered the questions there is no doubt that they must have had opportunity to look at the relevant documents and answer the questions,1
4,We are also satisfied that there is no substance in the complaint that the questioning bordered on cross-examination,1
4,Undoubtedly the learned Additional Sessions judge has questioned the respondents very fully and elaborately but to say that this bordered on cross- examination is wholly unjustifiable,1
4,"The object of the learned Additional Sessions Judge quite clearly was, as already stated, to leave no loophole for a complaint to be made before the appellate court of incomplete or insufficient examination under s. 342.Finally we are clear that it was not the duty of the court to draw the pointed attention of the respondents to the provisions of sub-s",1
4,"4) of s. 342 and tell them that they may, if they chose, enter the witness box",1
4,It is true that by introducing this provision the disability placed on an accused person in respect of giving evidence on oath in his own defence has been removed and to that extent such person is placed on par with an accused person under the English law,1
4,"The new provision, however, does no more than lift the ban and does not impose a duty on the court to draw the attention of an accused person to its contents",1
4,"Apart from that, the respondents were represented by counsel at the trial who knew very well what the law was",1
4,"No complaint was made by the respondents even in appeal that they were ignorant of their right, that had they known about it they would have given evidence on oath in their defence and that because of this they have been prejudiced",1
4,In the circumstances this point must also be rejected as being without substance,1
4,The irrelevant evidence to which Mr. Bhimasankaram referred was certain account books,1
4,"The entries in the. account books of VESCO show that certain sums of money were paid to various parties, Crompton Engineering Co., Lumin Electric Co., D. Brothers, Radio and Electrical, Madras, Vizagapatam Municipality, P. V. Ramanayya Bros., and Andhra Power System",1
4,They also show payment case was that the payments which were entered in the account of VESCO do not find a place in the account books of the corresponding firms or authorities because they were never made by VESCO,1
4,The High Court has pointed out that the main evidence on which the prosecution rests its case that the amount represented by the entries against these various firms were in,1
4,"fact misappropriated by the, respondents in the circumstance that there are no corresponding entries in the account books of those firms",1
4,"The argument before the High Court was and before us is that, the absence of an entry cannot of electricity duty to Government",1
4,The prosecution be established by reference to s. 34 of the Indian Evidence Act which reads thus,1
4,What it does is to make entries in books of account regularly kept in the course of business relevant in all proceedings in a court of law,1
4,"These entries are, however, not by themselves sufficient to charge any person with liability",1
4,"Therefore, when A sues B for a sum of money it is open to him to put his account books' in evidence provided they are regularly kept in the course of business and show by reference to them that the amount claimed by him is debited against B",1
4,"The entry though made by A in his own account books, and though it is in his own favour is a piece of evidence which the court may take into consideration for the purpose of determining whether the amount referred to therein was in fact paid by A to B",1
4,The entry by itself is of no help to A in his claim against B but it can be considered by the court along with the evidence of A for drawing the conclusion that the amount was paid by A to B,1
4,To this limited extent entries -in the account books are relevant and can be proved,1
4,S. 34 does not go beyond that,1
4,It says nothing about non-existence of entries in account books,1
4,"We, therefore, agree with the High Court that the account books of the various concerns to whom payments are said to have been made by the respondents are not by themselves evidence of the fact that no payments were received by them",1
4,The decision in Queen Empress v. Grees Chunder Banerjee ((1884) I. L. R. 10,1
4,"Cal 1024.), upon which reliance is placed by the High Court in support of its view is also to that effect",1
4,Similarly in Ram prashad Singh v. Lakhpati Koer ((1902) I. L. R. 30,1
4,"Cal 231, 247",1
4,Lord Robertson during the course of the hearing has observed that no inference can be drawn from the absence of any entry relating to any particular matter which observation supports the view taken in Queen Empress v. Girish Chander Banerjee ( (1884) I.L.R. 10 C.L 1024,1
4,"That , however, is not the Only provision to be Considered",1
4,There is s. II of the Evidence Act which provides that facts not otherwise relevant are relevant if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact,1
4,"Some of the facts in issue in this case are whether payments of certain sums of money were made to Crompton Engineering Co., and other firms or authorities",1
4,These are relevant facts,1
4,Absence of entries in their account books would be inconsistent with the receipt of the accounts and would thus be a relevant fact which can be proved under s. 11,1
4,The fact that no payments were received by those firms has been deposed to by persons connected with those firms and whose duty it was to receive and acknowledge amounts received by the firms or who were in charge of the accounts of these firms,1
4,"For the purpose of showing that no amounts were received by the firms, their account books would thus be as relevant as the VESCO account books for the purpose of showing the contrary",1
4,"Similarly there is s. 5 of the Evidence Act which reads thus:"" ""It is the case of the prosecution that the alleged payments were never made by VESCO to the various firms",0
4,It is also their case that these firms maintain their accounts in the regular course of business and it is their practice to enter in those accounts all payments received by them,0
4,"Both the sets of facts are relevant, that is, non-receipt of the amounts by the firms and non-existence of entries in their account books pertaining to those amounts",0
4,"It is permissible, therefore, for the prosecution to lead evidence to , Drove both these facts",0
4,The best evidence to prove the latter set of facts consists of the account books of the firms themselves,0
4,It is under these provisions that the account books of the firms must be held to be relevant,0
4,What value to attach to them is another matter and would be for the Court of fact to consider,0
4,It may further - be mentioned that the account books of VESCO show certain payments made to Billimoria & Co. of Kharagpur,0
4,Papers seized by the police include receipts purporting to have been signed by one J. J. Billimoria on behalf of the firm,0
4,The prosecution case is that these receipts are forged documents and the entries in the account books of VESCO are false,0
4,One of the partners of the firm was examined by the prosecution as a witness in the case and he produced the account books of the firm,0
4,Those account books are in Gujrati and he stated in his evidence that the accounts were regularly kept and that there were no entries in them corresponding to the entries in the VESCO accounts,0
4,The High Court held that since the account books were not translated they are not admissible in evidence,0
4,The High Court was clearly wrong in so holding,0
4,In coming to this conclusion it has relied upon the provisions of s. 356 (2A) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,0
4,"That section reads thus:"" ""This provision relates only to the oral evidence adduced in a case and not to documentary evidence",0
4,"Mr. Bhimasankaram, therefore, very rightly did not support the view of the High Court",0
4,In the circumstances we wish to say nothing further on the point,0
4,"We may, however, point out that Billimoria himself gave his evidence in English",0
4,"Another point urged by Mr. Bhimasankaram was that as many as 2, 000 documents were ""dumped"" by the prosecution in this case out of which 1600 documents were not sought to be proved by it",2
4,"Further, 64 documents were missing from the records when they came to the High Court and that this has caused serious prejudice to the respondent",2
4,"No objection, however, was taken in the courts below on this score and in the absence of any prejudice to the respondents",1
4,we do not think that we should take notice of the complaint made by Mr. Bhimasankaram,1
4,"The third point stressed by him was that the approver was allowed to refresh his memory, while deposing in the case, by referring extensively to the account books and various documents produced in the case",1
4,"This, according to him, was an absue of the provisions of s. 159 of the Evidence Act",1
4,"Now, s. 159 expressly enables a witness while under examination to refresh his memory by referring to any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is being questioned or soon afterwards, or to a writing made -similarly by another person and read by the witness immediately or soon after the writing was made",1
4,S. 160 provides that a witness may also testify to the facts mentioned in any such document as is mentioned in s. 159,1
4,The complaint of Mr. Bhimasankaram is that the approver should have been questioned about the various facts which were sought to be established through his evidence and it was only if and when he was in a difficulty that he should have been allowed to refer to the account books,1
4,Instead of doing that what he was permitted to do was just to prove the various documents or read those documents and then depose with reference to them,1
4,"In our opinion, where a witness has to depose to a large number of transactions , and those transactions referred to are or mentioned either in the account books or in other documents there is nothing wrong in allowing the witness to refer to the account books and the documents while answering the questions put to him in his examination",1
4,He cannot be expected to remember every transaction in all its details and s. 160 specifically permits a witness to testify the facts mentioned in the documents referred to in s. 159 although he has no recollection of the facts themselves if he is sure that the facts were correctly recorded in the document,1
4,That is precisely what happened in this case and we do not think that the Additional Sessions judge adopted a procedure which was either a violation of law or was an abuse of the power of the Court,1
4,The next point is a formidable one,1
4,"According to Mr. Bhimasankaram, the pardon tendered to the approver was illegal and if the pardon is illegal his evidence is wholly inadmissible",1
4,"Further, according to him, the evidence of the approver was found by the Additional Sessions judge to be unreliable and therefore, the first condition referred to in Sarwan Singh v. The State of Punjab , was not satisfied",1
4,For all these reasons the evidence of the approver must be left out of account,1
4,"If it is left out of account, he contends, there is nothing left in the prose- cution case, because, as pointed out by the Additional Sessions judge himself the evidence of the approver is the pivot of the prosecution case",1
4,The pardon is stated to be illegal for two reasons,1
4,The first reason is that none of the offences alleged to have been committed falls within s. 337 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the second reason is that the pardon was granted by an authority not empowered to grant it,1
4,S. 337 (1) as it stood before its amendment by Act 26 of 1955 read thus,1
4,His contention is that where none of the offences is exclusively triable by the High Court or the Court of Sessions pardon could be granted only if the offences are punishable with imprisonment which could extend to ten years but not if a higher punishment were provided for them,2
4,"Here, one of the offences alleged against the respondents is criminal breach of trust punishable under s. 409, I.P.C",2
4,"It is not exclusively triable by a Court of Sessions and the punishment as set out in the 7th column of Schedule II, Cr",2
4,P. C. was transportation for life or imprisonment of either description for ten years and fine,2
4,"He contends that since the offence is punishable with transportation for life, s. 337 (1) could not be availed of for granting pardon to the approver",2
4,It seems to us that it would not be correct to read s. 337 (1) in the way sought by learned counsel,2
4,The very object of this provision is to allow pardon to be tendered in cases where a grave offence is alleged to have been committed by several persons so that with the aid of the evidence of the person pardoned the offence could be brought home to the rest,2
4,The gravity is of course to be determined with reference to the sentence awardable with respect to that offence,2
4,"On the strength of these considerations Mr. Chari for the State contends that if the words ""any offence punishable with imprisonment which may extend to 10 years"" were interpreted to mean offences which were punishable with imprinsonment of less than 10 years grave offences which are not exclusively triable by a court of Sessions will be completely out of s. 337 (1",2
4,He suggests that this provision can also be reasonably interpreted to mean that where the offences are punishable with imprisonment exceeding 10 years pardon may be granted to the approver,2
4,"No doubt, if this interpretation is accepted the object of the section, that is, to embrace within it the graver offences, would be fulfilled, but we wish to express no opinion on it",1
4,"For, the pardon granted in -this case can be regarded as being within the ambit of s. 337 (1) for another reason",1
4,"It will be noticed that transportation for life was not the only punishment provided for an offence under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code even before the amendment made to the Indian Penal Code by s. 117 of the Act 26 of 1955, the other alternative being imprisonment up to 10 years",1
4,"Therefore, since the offence under s. 409 was not merely punishable with transportation for life but alternately also punishable with imprisonment which could extend to 10 years, s. 337 (1) would apply",1
4,This section does not expressly say that the only punishment provided for the offence should be imprisonment not exceeding 10 years,1
4,The reason why two alternative maximum sentences are given in col,1
4,"7, that is, transportation for life (now imprisonment for life) and imprisonment not exceeding 10 years appears to be that the offence is not exclusively triable by a court of session and could also be tried by a Magistrate, who, except when empowered under s. 30 would be incompetent to try offences punishable with transportation for life (now imprisonment for life) and the further reason that it should be open to the court of Session, instead of awarding the sentence of transportation for life to a convicted person to award him imprisonment in a jail in India itself for a period not execeeding 10 years",1
4,"Now, of course, by the amendment made by s. 117 of Act 26 of 1955 for the words ""transportation for life"" the words ""imprisonment for life"" have been substituted, but the original structure of all the sections now amended continues",1
4,"That is why they read rather queer but even so they serve the purpose of allowing certain offences triable by a court of Session, to be triable also by Magistrates of the First Class",1
4,"Be that as it may, there is no substance in the first ground",1
4,What we have said about pardon in respect of an offence under s. 409 would apply equally to that for one under s. 120-B because the punishment for it is the same as that for the offence under s. 409,1
4,"The offence under s. 467 read with s. 471 is punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description for a period of 10 years but it is exclusively triable by a court of Session and, therefore, in so far as such offence is concerned the argument of Mr. Bhimasankaram would not even have been available",1
4,"As regards the offence under s. 477-A, it is one of those sections which are specifically enumerated in s. 337 (1) and the argument advanced before us-and which we have rejected would not even be available with regard to the pardon in respect of that offence",1
4,It is true that the respondent No,1
4,I alone was convicted by the Additional Sessions judge of this offence and the offence under s. 467 read with s. 471 but the validity of a pardon is to be determined with reference to the offence alleged against the approver alone and not with reference to the offence or offences for which his associates were ultimately convicted,1
4,"Coming to the next ground of attack on the validity of pardon, the argument of Mr. Bhimasankaram is that whereas s. 337 (1) speaks of pardon being granted by a District Magistrate, or Presidency Magistrate, a Sub-Divisional Magistrate or any Magistrate of First Class, except in cases where an enquiry or trial was pending before another Magis- tratc, the pardon here was granted by the Additional District Magistrate in a case where an enquiry was pending before the District Magistrate and is, therefore, illegal and of no avail",2
4,He contends that s. 337 (1) speaks of the District Magistrate which expression does not include an Additional District Magistrate,2
4,"Mr. Bhimasankaram's argument on the point may be summarised thus : Such a power cannot be conferred upon an Additional District Magistrate because s. 337 (1) does not contemplate grant of pardon by an Additional District Magistrate and that the Additional District Magistrate would have no status other than that of a Magistrate, First Class",1
4,"No doubt, under entry (9-a) in Part III of Sch",1
4,"III to the Code a Magistrate, First Class, has the power to grant pardon under s. 337 but it is limited by the proviso thereto to certain classes of cases",1
4,A case under enquiry or trial before another magistrate does not fall in any of these classes,1
4,"Therefore, a pardon granted by him in such a case would be illegal",1
4,The Magistrate before whom the enquiry or trial is proceeding or the District Magistrate would be the only authorities competent to grant a pardon in such a case,1
4,"Alternatively, the State Government has not made any directions under sub-s",1
4,2) of s. 10 specifying the powers of the District Magistrate which would lie exercisable by the Additional District Magistrate concerned,1
4,In order to appreciate and consider the argument it is desirable to bear in mind the changes in the magisterial set up in the former province of Madras which comprised within it the district of Visakhapatnam,1
4,"By Government Order No. 3106 dated September 9, 1949 the Government of the Province of Madras issued certain instructions to the Magistrates in pursuance of the separation of the judiciary from the executive",1
4,"It divided the magistrates into two groups, Judicial magistrates and executive magistrates",1
4,"The latter category comprises of the executive officers of the Revenue Department, on whom the responsibility for the maintenance of law and order was to continue to rest",1
4,Para 4 of the instructions provides,1
4,"Para 5 provides that as officers of the Revenue Department, those magistrates would be under the control of the Government through the Board of Revenue",1
4,The Additional District Magistrates (Independent) would also be under the control of the Government through the Board of Revenue,1
4,The category of judicial Magistrates was constituted of the following: (1) District Magistrate; (2) Sub-divisional Magistrates; (3) Additional First Class Magistrates and (4) Second Class Magistrates (Sub- magistrates,1
4,The District Magistrate was constituted as the principal magistrate of the District and as such was entrusted with the duty of general administration and superintendence and control over the other judicial magis- trates in the district,1
4,"In addition to his general supervisory functions and the special powers under the Code of hearing revision petitions, transfer petitions, appeals from Second Class Magistrates and the like, the District Magistrate was also to be assigned a specific area, the cases arising from which would be disposed of normally by himself",1
4,This body of magistrates was made subordinate to the High Court,1
4,Till the separation between the judiciary and the executive was effected the Collector as the head of the Revenue Department was also the District Magistrate,1
4,Consequent on the separation,1
4,he became only an Additional District Magistrate,1
4,Part IV of the Government order deals with the allocation of powers between the judicial and executive magistrates,1
4,Para 19(3) occurring in this part deals with allocation of powers under the provisions of the Code otherwise than these referred to in the earlier paragraphs,1
4,It specifically provides that the power to tender pardon udder s. 337 shall be exercised by executive magistrates except in cases referred to in the proviso to sub-s,1
4,"1) of that section, in which case a judicial magistrate may exercise that power",1
4,"In spite of the Government order all Magistrates who have, under Sch",1
4,"III to the Code of Criminal procedure the power to grant pardon will continue to have that power and, therefore, a pardon granted by a judicial Magistrate in contravention of the Government order will not be rendered invalid",1
4,"However, that is not the point which is relevant while considering the argument of Mr. Bhimasankaram",1
4,"His point is that the proviso to s. 337(1) confers the power on ""the District Magistrate"" to grant pardon in a case pending before another Magistrate and not on ""a District Magistrate"" and, therefore, his power to grant pardon in such cases cannot be conferred under sub-s.(2) of s. 10 on an Additional District Magistrate",1
4,"According to him, under that section only the powers of ""a District Magistrate"" meaning thereby only the powers under Entry 7 (a) in Part V of Sch",1
4,III,1
4,as distinguished from the power under the proviso to s. 337 (1) can be conferred upon an Additional District Magistrate,1
4,"Secondly, according to him, no direction has in fact been shown to have been made by the State Government conferring upon an Additional District Magistrate the power of the District Magistrate to grant pardon",1
4,"In our opinion, there is no subtance in the contention",1
4,The power conferred by sub-s,1
4,1) of s. 337 on the different clauses of Magistrates is of the same character,1
4,The power to grant pardon in a case pending before another Magistrate is no doubt conferred by the proviso only on the District Magistrate,1
4,But Entry 7 (a) in Part V of Sch,1
4,III when it refers to the power of a District Magistrate under s. 337 (1) does not exclude the power under the proviso,1
4,"There is, therefore, no warrant for drawing a distinction between the powers of ""the District Magistrate"" and the powers of ""'a District Magistrate",1
4,The power of a District Magistrate to grant Pardon has been specifically conferred on Additional District Magistrates as would appear from s,1
4,no,1
4,37 of Sch,1
4,"III of the Government Order, which reads thus",1
4,"Mr. Chari for the State advanced a further argument before us in case his main argument that the pardon was valid failed and said that the approver, even if we ignore the pardon, was a competent witness",2
4,In support of his contention he strongly relied upon the decision in Kandaswamy Gounder,2
4,"In re : the appellant (I.L.R. 1957 Mad 715 ), and the cases referred to therein, in particular the decision in Winson v. Queen ((1866) L.R. I Q.B",2
4,"What has been held in all these cases is that where the trial of a person who was charged with having committed an offence or offences jointly with several persons is separated from the trial of those persons, he would be a competent witness against them though of course there will always be the question as to what weight should be attached to his evidence",2
4,"Mr. Chari then referred to s. 133 of the Evidence Act and pointed out that this section clearly makes an accomplice evidence admissible in a case and that an approver whose pardon is found to be invalid does not cease to be an accomplice and contends that he is, therefore, as competent a witness as he would have been if he had not been granted pardon at all and not been put on trial",2
4,"Learned counsel further pointed out that the decisions show that however undesirable it may be to adduce the evidence of a person jointly accused of having committed an offence along with others, his evidence is competent and admissible except when it is given in a case in which he is being actually tried",2
4,"This legal position does not, according to him, offend the guarantee against testimonial compulsion and he points out that that is the reason why an accused person is not to be administered an oath when the court examines him under s. 342 (1) for enabling him to explain the circumstances appearing in evidence against him",2
4,If pardon is tendered to an accused person and eventually it is found that the pardon is illegal such person is pushed back into the rank of an accused person and being no more than an accomplice would be a competent witness,2
4,The question raised is an important one and requires a serious consideration,1
4,"Mr. Chari in support of his contention has cited a large number of cases, Indian as well as English, and certain passages from Halsbury's Laws of England",1
4,"But in the view we take about the legal validity of the pardon tendered, we do not wish to pronounce one way or the other on this very interesting question",1
4,"Now, as regards the reliability of the approver",1
4,"It is no doubt true that an approver has always been regarded as an infamous witness, who, on his own showing has participated in a crime or crimes and later to save his own skin, turned against his former associates and agreed to give evidence against them in the hope that he will be pardoned for the offence committed by him",1
4,The High Court seems to think that before reliance could be placed upon the evidence of the approver it must appear that he is a penitent witness,1
4,"That, in our opinion, is not the correct legal position",1
4,"The section itself shows that the motivating factor for an approver to turn, what in England is called ""King's evidence"" is the hope of pardon and not any noble sentiment like contrition at the evil in which he has participated",1
4,"Whether the evidence of the approver should in any given case be accepted or not will have to be determined by applying the usual tests such as the probability of the truth of what he has deposed to the circumstances in which he has come to give evidence whether he has made a full and complete disclosure, whether his evidence is merely self-exculpatory and so on and so forth",1
4,"The court has, in addition, to ascertain whether his evidence has been corroborated sufficiently in material particulars",1
4,What is necessary to consider is whether applying all these tests we should act upon the evidence of the approver should be acted upon,1
4,"We however, find that certain documents upon which Mr. Chari wants to rely are not included in the paper book",1
4,It would take considerable time if we were to adjourn this matter now and give an opportunity to the parties to include those documents on record,1
4,The better course would be for us to set aside the acquittal of the respondents and send back the appeal to the High Court ?or being decided on merits,1
4,The High Court will of course be bound by the finding which we have given on the questions of law agitated before us,1
4,What it must now do is to consider the entire evidence and decide for itself whether it is sufficient to bring home all or any of the offences to the respondents,1
4,We may mention that the High Court's observation that the approver's evidence was treated as unreliable by the learned Additional Sessions judge is not correct,1
4,"Of course, the view taken by the Additional Sessions judge is not binding on the High Court",1
4,But it should remove from its mind the misconception that the Additional Sessions judge has not believed him,1
4,There is another thing which we would like to make clear,1
4,"The decision in Sarwan Singh v. The State of Punjab ([1957] B. C. R. 953.), on which reliance has been placed by the High Court has been explained by this Court in the case of Maj",1
4,E. G. Barsay v. The State of Bombay,1
4,"This Court has pointed out in the latter decision that while it must be shown that the approver is a witness of truth, the evidence adduced in a case cannot be considered in compartments and that even for judging the credibility of, the approver the evidence led to corroborate him in material particulars would be relevant for consideration",1
4,The High Court should bear this in mind for deciding whether the evidence of the approver should be acted upon or not,1
4,Then again it would not be sufficient for the High Court to deal with the evidence in a general way,1
4,It would be necessary for it to consider for itself the evidence adduced by the prosecution on the specific charges and then to conclude whether those charges have been established or not,1
4,"The prosecution would be well, advised if, instead of placing the evidence on each and every one of those large number of charges against the respondents, it chooses to select a few charges under each head other than the head of conspiracy and concentrates on establishing those charges, this would save public time and also serve the purpose of the prosecution",1
4,With these observations we set aside the acquittal of the respondents and remit the appeal to the High Court for decision on merits in the light of our observations,1
4,Appeal allowed,4
4,Case remanded,4
5,This Appeal is by Special leave against the Judgment of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana confirming the conviction of the accused under Section 5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947 as also the sentence awarded by the Sessions Judge of one year's Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of Rs,1

5,"On the next day another Notification was issued under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act on November 28, 1962 and in view of the emergency action under Section 17 was taken for obtaining possession of the land With a view to its development",6

5,Before the land was actually acquired the Appellant who was a Major in the Military Engineering-Service was working as a Garrison Engineer and was inching of the extension,2
5,"He had in anticipation of acquisition and execution of the work appointed A. B. Ranadive, P.W. 14 as Assistant Garrison Engineer who was to be responsible, for all the matters connected with the acquisition of land, demarcation of boundaries as an Engineer Inching for execution of the contract and responsible for the maintenance of the Air Field",2
5,"The work of the extension of aerodynamic was entrusted to one Telu Ram, P.W. 8 Contractor, with whom the trusted to M.E.S. Department entered into an agreement on December 3, 1962",2
5,This agreement was signed both by the Appellant and P.W. 14,2
5,The work according to that agreement was to be done in 2 phases-first phase was to commence on 10th January 1963 and was to be completed by 9th October 1963,2
5,After the completion of the first phase the second phase was to start on 10th October 1963 and completed by 9th May 1964,2
5,"Pursuant to this agreement it is said that -symbolic possession of the land which was acquired was taken over by the Tehsildar on 1st February 1963, after which at any rate it appears from Ex",2
5,P. 24 that actual possession of this land was handed over by the said Tehsildar on 13th,2
5,February 1963 to the appellant,2
5,The receipt Ex.P.24,2
5,"24 bears the signature of N. L. Handa, the Tehsildar and of Sukhchain Lal jain, P.W. 11 on behalf of the Military Estate Officer and the Appellant",2
5,From this receipt it is evident that possession of 50.12 acres was handed over by the Tehsildar and taken over by the Appellant and the Military Estate Officer Sukhchain Lal Jain,2
5,The case of the prosecution initially was that after the land so acquired with the standing crop was taken possession of by the Appellant,6
5,he sold the crop to Moti Ram and Kewal Chand for Rs,6
5,2500 and facilitated the cutting and taking away of the crop by postponing the handing over of the possession to the contractor till the 5th April 1963 and misappropriated the money,6
5,In respect of this allegation the First Information Report (Ex. P. 29) was issued on 14-1-64 in which the following statement is relevant,6
5,It is alleged that Major Som Nath accused who is a Garrison Engineer Sirsa Air Field subsequently sometime in the months of March and April 1963 permitted the removal of the standing crop valued at Rs,6
5,11073-13 by Shri Moti Ram and Kewal Chand etc,6
5,"after, accepting illegal gratification of Rs. 3000 from them",6
5,Major Som Nath did not account for this amount in the Govt,6
5,Revenues,6
5,He thus. abused his position as a public servant and caused pecuniary advantage to said Shri Moti Ram and Kewal Chand by giving them standing crops worth Rs,6
5,"13,000 for a consideration of",6
5,Rs,6
5,"3,000 only, which amount he accepted for his personal use and thereby also abused his official position and obtained pecuniary advantage, for himself in a sum of Rs",6
5,The facts disclose the commission of the offence of criminal misconduct as defined in Section 5(1)(d) read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947 by Major Som Nath accused,0
5,"A regular case, is therefore registered and entrusted to Inspector Baldev Rai Handa for investigation",6
5,"After this F.I.R. certain statements were recorded by the Military authorities being DA to DE,DM, DM/ 1, DN & DL of Mani gain, Mulkh, Raj, Ganpat Ram, Telu Ram, Kewal Chand and Sukhchain Lal Jain",6
5,A chargesheet was filed against the Appellant under Section 5 (1) (c) and 5 (1) (d) read with 5 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act on 5-8-1966 after obtaining sanction from the Govt,6
5,"of India, Ministry of Home Affairs on llth April, 1966 as per Ex. P.23",6
5,The Special Judge acquitted the Appellant of the second charge namely that being a public servant he had by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing his position as a public servant obtained for himself a sum of Rs,3
5,"2,500 from Moti Ram of Sirsa for cutting the crops and thereby committed ,offence under Section 5(1)(d) punishable under Section 5(2",3
5,The accused was however convicted under the first charge for an offence under Section 5(1)(c) in that he being a Garrison Engineer incharge of the Air Field,6
5,"Sirsa and in that capacity entrusted with standing crops of Sarson, Gram and Lusan on 30 acres of land a part of 49 acres of land acquired by the Govt",6
5,and which had been valued at Rs,6
5,"11,073.13 by the Revenue authorities, dishonestly or fraudulently allowed Moti Ram of Sirsa to misappropriate the said standing crop and thereby contravened Section 5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act punishable with Section 5(2) of that Act",6
5,Against that conviction and sentence he -appealed to the High Court which maintained the conviction and sentence,6
5,"The learned Advocate for the Appellant has meticulously taken us through the entire documentary and oral evidence and commented at length upon the various contradictions and incongruities in the case of the prosecution with a view to establishing that when the Appellant took possession of the land there was no crop standing on it-that tile possession of the land 'was in fact delivered to Telu Ram, Contractor on 10-1-1963; that the said Contractor had admitted 'that possession of the entire land was received by him; that he carried on the construction work in extending the Aerodrome; that 200/250 donkeys were also used for doing the work by reason of which the crop was damaged before Tehsildar had put the Appellant in possession of the land and as a matter of fact there was no crop thereon when he got the possession of the land",2
5,"It was also contended that the High Court had not considered the contradictions in the earlier statement made by some of the witnesses to the Military authorities and that it relied on many of the documents for affirming the conviction of the Appellant without their actually being put to, him under Section 342",2
5,"Before we consider these contentions it is necessary to determine another submission of the learned Advocate for the Appellant which goes to the root of the jurisdiction of the Court to try the offence, under Section 5(1)(c",1
5,If this contention is valid then the conviction of the accused cannot stand and therefore it is necessary to deal with this matter first,1
5,"It may be mentioned that though a complaint was made in the application for a certificate for leave to appeal to this Court that the learned Single Judge of the High Court should have acquitted the Appellant on the sole ground that there was no proper sanction for the prosecution of the Appellant under Section 5(1) (c) of the Prevention of the Corruption Act, this question does not seem to have been urged before the High Court",1
5,In any case we do not think that there is any validity in the submission,1
5,that the sanction given by the Govt,1
5,of India does not cover the trial of the charge under Section 5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act,1
5,For a sanction to be valid it must be established that the sanction was given in respect of the facts constituting the offence with which the accused is proposed to be charged,1
5,"Though it is desirable that the facts should be referred to in the sanction itself, nonetheless if they do not appear on the face of it, the prosecution must establish aliunde by evidence that those facts were placed before the sanctioning authorities",1
5,It is therefore necessary to first examine the order of sanction to ascertain on what facts it has been accorded,1
5,The sanction that has been accorded is in the following terms: 11th April 1966,6
5,"Whereas it is alleged that Major Som Nath...... while functioning as Garrison Engineer, M.E.S., Air Field at Sirsa from 13-2-63 to 54-1963 by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing his position, as such public servant, obtained pecuniary advantage of Rs",6
5,2500 for allowing the standing crops to be cut from the land acquired for the extension of Air Field,6
5,Sirsa; and or he dishonestly or fraudulently realised and misappropriated Rs,6
5,2500 during the aforesaid period as the value of the crops cut from the land acquired for the extension of Air Field,6
5,"Sirsa, which crops had been entrusted to him as a public servant and he instead of depositing the said sale price into the Govt",6
5,"Treasury converted it to his own use; And whereas the said acts of Major Som Nath.. constituted offences punishable under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, read With Section 5 (1) (c) and (d",6
5,Act No. 11 of 1947) of the said Act and Section 409 of the I.P.C,6
5,And whereas the Central Govt,6
5,"after fully and carefully examining the materials before it in regard to the said allegations and circumstances of the case, consider that Major Som Nath...... should be prosecuted in a court of law for the said offences",6
5,"Now therefore, the Central Govt both hereby accord sanction under Section 197-Code of Criminal Procedure (Act No. 5 of 1898) and Section 6(1)(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (Act II of 1947) for the prosecution of Maj",6
5,Som Nath for the said offences and for any other offences punishable under the provision of law in respect of the aforesaid acts by the Court of competent jurisdiction,6
5,By order and in the name of the President. Sd/- (A. P. Veera Raghavan,6
5,Deputy Secretary to the Govt,6
5,of India,6
5,From the above order it is apparent that the facts which the Central Govt,1
5,"considered for the purposes of according sanction were (a) that the Appellant as a public servant was entrusted with crops situated on the land acquired for the extension of Air Field, Sirsa ; (b) that by abusing his position as a public servant he allowed the standing crops to be cut from the said land",1
5,c,1
5,that by corrupt or illegal means and by abusing his position as a public servant he obtained pecuniary advantage Of Rs,1
5,2500 as the value of the crops to be cut from the land and/or he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriated that sum by converting it into his own use instead of depositing the said sale price in the Govt,1
5,Treasury,1
5,"On these facts and after applying its mind as spoken to by P.W. 10 Kalra the Government accorded its, sanction for prosecution of the offences punishable under Section 5(2) read with Section 5(1)(c) and 5(1)(d",0
5,The question therefore Would be whether these facts were sufficient to sustain the sanction under 5(1)(c) even if the charge under 5(1)(d) had failed,1
5,This question in turnwill depend upon what are the ingredients of the offences under 5(1)(c) and (d) read with Section 5(2,1
5,"Under 5(1)(c)-A Public servant is said to commit the offence of misconduct in the discharge of his duty if he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriates or otherwise converts for' his own use any property entrusted to him or under his control as a public servant or allows any other person so to do, and under (d) if he by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing his position as a public servant, obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage",0
5,It would be seen therefore that under Section 5(1)(c) a public servant will be said to commit the offence of misconduct in hi& duties if he dishonestly allows any other persons to convert to his own use property Which is entrusted to the said public servant The facts which have been set out in the order granting the sanction certainly are sufficient to indicate that the authorities granting the sanction had the offence under Section 5(1)(c) also in their contemplation,1
5,In fact the order specifically mentions thisprovision while granting sanction,1
5,We should have thought this Was an obvious conclusion but the learned Advocate for the Appellant strenuously contended that the charge against the Appellant was of a motiveless offenceand in any case the facts as disclosed show that not only at thetime when the First Information Report was given but even at the time when sanction was accorded that the prosecution wag merely concerned with the charge that the appellant bad allowed the crops to be cut on the condition that Rs. 2500 will be paid and received the money and misappropriated or converted it tohis own use by not paying it into the Govt,1
5,treasury,1
5,There is therefore no basis for sanction for a charge under Section 5(1)(c,1
5,it is further contended that the stand taken by the prosecution was that 'the persons who we're permitted to cut the crops bad' not committed any offence,2
5,"If so a charge under Section 5(1)(c) would implicate those persons also in the commission of an offence which certainly would not have, been in the contemplation of the authorities granting the sanction",1
5,"In support of this contention three decisions have been cited before us namely Bhagat Ram v. State of Punjab  1954 Indlaw SC 188, Madan Mohan Singh V. State of U. P., Privy Council 82",1
5,"and Gokulchand Dwarkadas Mordrka v. The King,  1948 Indlaw PC 39",1
5,"Bhagat Ram's case was not concerned with the sanction but only with the question, whether the offence could be altered to one of abetment of an offence of Section 409 I.P.C. from one under Section 409 simpliciter",5
5,It was held that an alteration of the Appellant's conviction' under Section 409 I.P.C. into one of abetment thereof would imply a definite finding against the subordinate Judge who is not before the Court and as such it would be unfair to make such an alteration,5
5,"We do not see how this case can assist the appellant because in the first ace there is no question of an alteration, of the charge and secondly the circumstance that someone who is not a public servant abetted the appellant is hardly relevant",1
5,"But even so the offence with which the appellant is charged under Section 5(1)(c) does not necessarily involve ,An abetment with the person whom he had dishonestly allowed to- cut and take away the crop",1
5,"For instance it is quite possible that the person whom he allowed to cut the crop may be his own relation or friend in whom he may be interested and who may, however, not know that the accused was doing something dishonest in permitting him to cut the crop",1
5,"in any case the facts which have been stated, in the sanction clearly indicate that the appellant has dishonestly allowed the crops to be cut so that there is no question of any inference or implication that the persons cutting the crops were abetting him in the offence",1
5,Even if it were so the sanction cannot be held to be had on that account,1
5,"Gokulchand Dwarkadas's case also is of no assistance to the appellant because in that case the sanction did not disclose the facts on which it was given but merely sanctioned the prosecution for a breach of certain provisions, Sir John Beamont delivering the Judgement of the Judicial Committee, observed at page 84: ""But if the facts constituting the offence charged are not shown on the face of the sanction, the prosecution must prove by extraneous evidence that those, facts were placed before the sanctioning authority",5
5,"Nor, in their Lordships' view, is a sanction given without reference to the facts constituting the offence a compliance with the actual terms of cl",5
5,Under that clause sanction has to be given to a prosecution for the contravention of any of the provision of the Order,5
5,"A person could not be charged merely with the breach of a particular provision of the Order; he must be charged with the commission of certain acts which constitute a breach, and it is to that prosecution that is for having done acts which constitution breach of the Order-that the sanction 'is required",5
5,"In the present case -there is nothing on the face ,of the sanction, and no extraneous evidence, to show that the sanctioning authority knew the facts alleged to constitute a breach of the Order, and the sanction is invalid",5
5,The case of Jaswant Singh v. The State of Puniab,5
5,1957 Indlaw SC 59 was also cited by the Respondent's advocate in support of the contention that the trial of two offences requiring sanction was not valid,5
5,In that case sanction was given under Section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 47 for the prosecution of the appellant for having received illegal gratification from one Pal Singh,5
5,He was charged with and tried for two offences under Section 5(1) (a) of the Act for habitually accepting or obtaining illegal gratification and under Section 5(1)(d) for receiving illegal gratification from Pal Singh,5
5,The Session Judge had found that both charges were proved,5
5,While in Appeal the High Court held that the Appellant could neither be tried nor convicted of the offence under 5(1)(a) as no sanction had been given in respect of it but upheld the conviction under Section 5(1)(d) for which sanction had been given,5
5,A perusal of the sanction would show that the sanctioning authority had applied their mind to only one instance but the prosecution were seeking to make the sanction cover the offence of a habitual bribe taker which clearly implies that the sanctioning authorities must consider the number of instances when the accused took bribes and on what occasions as would justify a charge of his being a habitual bribe taker,5
5,"Sinha, J, as he then was while dismissing the appeal observed at page 766",5
5,In the present case the sanction strictly construed indicates the consideration by the sanctioning authority of the facts relating to the receiving of the illegal gratification from Pal Singh and therefore the appellant could only be validly tried for that offence,5
5,"The contention that a trial for two offences requiring sanction is wholly void, where the sanction is granted for one offence and not for the other, is in our opinion unsustainable",5
5,Section 6(1) of the Act bars the jurisdiction of the Court to take cognizance of an offence for which previous sanction is required and has not been given,5
5,"The prosecution for offence under S. 5(1)(d) therefore is not barred because the proceedings are not without previous sanction which was validly given for the offence of receiving a bribe from Pal Singh, but the offence of habitually receiving illegal gratification could not be taken cognizance of and the prosecution and trial for that offence was void for want-of sanction which is a condition precedent for the Courts taking cognizance of the offence alleged to be committed and therefore the High Court has rightly set aside the conviction for that offence",5
5,"These cases instead of supporting the contention of the learned Advocate amply demonstrate that the facts which formed the basis of the sanction and which was accorded after the sanctioning authority had fully applied its mind to them, should be correlated to the particular offence or offences with which the accused is charged or convicted",1
5,In our view there is no justification for holding that the conviction under Section 5(1)(c) read with 5(2) is bad for want of the requisite sanction,1
5,"Now on the merits of the case as we said earlier the learned Advocate for the appellant has referred to the evidence in meticulous detail and has commented thereon, at length but this Court ordinarily does not reappropriation the evidence with a view to arriving at its own finding as if it was a Court of fact and does not ordinarily upset the findings of the High Court which has on an evaluation of the evidence affirmed the trial court's conviction and sentence",1
5,It has been contended firstly that the High Court was in error in relying on certain evidence for convicting the accused which was not put to him,1
5,Secondly the evidence that was necessary to unfold the story of the prosecution has not been produced by the prosecution but the Trial Court and the High Court ignored this lacunas in the prosecution case,1
5,"Thirdly the Judgments show that there was utter confusion in respect of the date on which possession of the acquired land was given to the Appellant and the date on which it was given to the Contractor for carrying on the work, as also in respect of the fact whether there was any crop standing when the Appellant took possession of the land and at what period of time the crop was cut and the work commenced",1
5,Before we deal with the contentions urged on behalf of the Appellant it is necessary to have a clear picture of certain broad features of the case,1
5,The Air strip which was being extended is in one straight line with Taxi-ways,1
5,P.W.14 Ranadive tells us that if one were to go from the entrance of Air Field to the acquired land one would have to pass through RD 4500 to 1200,1
5,The acquired land extended from RD 1200 to RD 00,1
5,"According to P.W. 8 Telu Ram, he acquired possession of the land of the length from RD 4500 to RD 1200 on 10th January 1963 and that tile possession of the acquired land was not delivered to him as it had not been acquired by that time",1
5,Ex,1
5,DO review report which is headed Technical Administration Contract shows that the date of review was 9th February 1963,1
5,"In this document the date of the conclusion of the contract is given as 3rd December'62 and date of commencement of work as 10th January'63, date of completion of 1st phase 9th October, '63 and second phase 9th May 1964",1
5,"To the Question ""Have all sites- been handed over on due date"" the answer shown- was an affirmative 'yes",1
5,There is However nothing in this document to show what is the site of' which possession was handed over to and taken by Telu Ram on 10th January '63,1
5,It is not the case of the Appellant that acquisition of the land on which the crop was standing had taken place nor could possession of it been handed over to him because he denies that there was any crop on the land when the possession of the land was handed over to him,1
5,"That there was crop on 'the land is amply born out by a letter of the Appellant dated 12th February 1963 addressed to Mr. G. L. Nagpal, Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Sirsa",1
5,"In this letter he says: - ""12th Feb. 1963",1
5,"My dear Mr. Nagpal, I am writing to you With regard to",1
5,acquisition of land for Sirsa Airfield,1
5,"As, you know",1
5,"the Additional Deputy Commissioner, Hissar will be visiting his location on 13th Feb. 1963",1
5,"The Military Estates Officer, Delhi, Mr. K. K. Gamkhar will also be here on 13th morning",1
5,It is desirable that entire proceedings With regard to acquisition of land and determining compensation for standing crops for the total area of 39.58 acres in Mirpur and Ahmadpur villages tire finalised an this date,1
5,"As I have told you personally, we are keen to finalise the proceedings for the total area to be acquired by us and not by phses",1
5,This is interest of the project,1
5,"I therefore request you to issue suitable instructions to, your staff so that all the relevant papers may be suitably prepared",1
5,"Even if Exhibit DQ gave a correct picture, it could be in relation to the airstrip already in existence, as this would be necessary for a contractor who is charged with duty to carry out extension work to go on the site collect materials and get everything ready to execute his contract",1
5,"In fact as we have noticed earlier this is what Telu Ram says in his evidence, namely that on loan January'63 no delivery of possession of the remaining land other than RD 4500 to 1200 (the land in which there is the existing run-way) was given",1
5,It was then that he wrote on 23-1-1963 as per Ex. 8 to the Assistant Garrison Engineer complaining that the possession of the whole of the land had not been delivered to him,1
5,A copy of this letter was sent to the Garrison Engineer-the Appellant,1
5,"This letter shows two things (a) that complete site 4500 to 0 ft. has not yet been handed over ""as it was presumed that the possession of the land could not be had so for"" and (b) that as levels have not been given, the final excavation of the foundation cannot be done and all subsequent operations are therefore withheld",1
5,This letter clearly indicates that some excavation was being done as otherwise there is no meaning in saying that final excavation cannot be done,1
5,This Is also consistent with the other evidence that some work was in progress Which gain is in accord with the evidence of Telu Ram P.W. 8 that he got the possession of RD 4500 to RD 1200,1
5,"The extension of the Airstrip would mean that the existing Airstrip is being extended, so that the initial work can be started and continued on the existing Airstrip",1
5,"It is not as if the existing Airstrip ends at the boundary of RD 4500 to RD 1200, so that the work of extension can go on in the existing Airstrip even before possession of the acquired land was given",1
5,"This is further confirmed by a perusal of the letter written by the Appellant to Telu Ram P.W. 8 in reply to his letter dated 28th February'63 (not produced) that ""Necessary possession of the, runway and taxi track has already been given to you",1
5,You are therefore requested to set out the work and get the same approved by the Engineerin- charge before starting the work,1
5,This shows that no work had in fact been undertaken on the land acquired and also that possession of the existing runway and track had already been given,1
5,Nothing is specifically mentioned about possession of the acquired land being given to him on that date,1
5,The work on that land is only at the stage of getting approval,1
5,Now the next question is When was the possession of the acquired land obtained by the Appellant and when did he deliver it to P.W. 8,1
5,"P.W. 14, says that symbolic possession was delivered to him in respect of the acquired land on the 1st February'63",1
5,It would however appear from Exh,1
5,"P. 24 that actual possession was delivered to the Appellant on 13th February '63 as per the delivery receipt executed by him, the Tehsildar and P.W.11, a representative of the Military Estate office and that even according to his letter already referred to Ex",1
5,P.13 there wag standing crop on the land,1
5,as otherwise there is no meaning in the Appellant saying therein that it is desirable that entire proceedings with regard to acquisition of land and determining compensation for standing crops for' the 'total area of 39- 58 acres are finalised on the 13th February,1
5,"There is also credible evidence that possession of the acquired land was not handed over to the contractor till late in, March '63 though, it was handed over to and, taken over by the Appellant on 13-2-63",1
5,The Khasra Girdawari Ex,1
5,"P.3 would show that there was a crop of Sargon (Mustard) Gram and Lusan, at any rate on 20th March 63 at a time when the land has been shown therein to have been in possession of the Military authorities",1
5,"P. 2 is a certified copy by the Tehsildar dated 18-9-63 which shows that as per the Girdawari on 20-3-63 crops were standing on the lands in the village Ahmedpur acquired by the Military authorities for Sirsa 3 Airfield construction, the details of which were that the total land acquired for Airfield 49 acres, the land on which crops were standing in good condition 23 acres and the land on which crops were standing in damaged condition 7 acres and uncultivated land 19 acres",1
5,Mani Ram Patwari had stated that by the 20th March 1963 some ground had been cleared,1
5,"Sukhchain Lal Jain P.W. 11 who had also come to obtain possession on behalf of the Military Estate Officer had said that he had seen some part of the crops had been cut by 13-2-1963, but was not aware who had cut them",1
5,"This evidence, however, does not assist the accused",1
5,"At the most it shows that a small portion of the crops were cut but it is apparent that that has not been taken into account by the Collector in assessing the value of the crop because it is on that day that crops were inspected for that purpose and subsequently the Agricultural Officer also had in his letter dated 18-2-63, which has been cited in the award Ex",1
5,P. 26 intimated that on inspection the crops were found to be very good,1
5,He had also given the approximate yield and the rate at which the crop can be valued with which the Collector agreed and awarded compensation,1
5,"It is therefore clear that in estimating the crop, the small portion of the land where crops were stated to have been cut by the 13-2-63 even if true could not have been taken into account",1
5,"It may also be stated that the Contractor had written to the, Garrison Engineer on 28-2-63 requesting him to hand over immediately the possession of the remaining portion of the land so that excavation work is not held up",1
5,He also inform in that letter that the excavation in all available portions of the taxi track and runway has been completed,1
5,This again does not specifically refer to the land which is being acquired,1
5,"At any rate on the 23rd March, 1963 P.W. 8 has again written to the Garrison Engineer namely the Appellant that the excavation of the taxi track could not be proceeded with for want of alignment to be given which was pending for want (because) of standing crops, in the land, the possession of which has not been given so far",1
5,"Thereafter the following pertinent statement appears namely- ""Now, today I find that the crops have been completely cut and as such it is requested that further necessary action in the matter of giving the alignment and possession of land may please be taken at your end",1
5,"On the 6th April, 1963 he has again written to the Garrison Engineer saying as follows",6
5,You have verbally asked me now to take the site after the crop is cut and the necessary marking of the alignment has been taken in hand but this handing over has not been shown on the site order book by the A.G.E. (B/R) despite my request,6
5,He may please be asked to complete this formality without any loss of time,6
5,In reply the Appellant states in his letter Ex,6
5,P. 12 dated the 10th April,6
5,The matter has already been discussed with you and finalised,6
5,No further action is required to be taken,6
5,It can be seen from the above that the appellant is reluctant to reply in writing as to what he is asking the contractor to do under verbal orders while the contractor for safeguarding his position is insisting on having it in writing,1
5,"The Trial Court as well as the High Court are in our view, justified in holding that crops of Sarson, gram and lusan were standing on the land acquired by the Military for extension of the Aerodrome",1
5,It will also justify the conclusion that they were there at any rate till the 20th March 1963 and according to the letter of the contractor (P.W. 8) on 23-3-63 they were completely cut,1
5,"In so far as handing over of the possession of the land to the Contractor (P.W. 8) is concerned, the Trial Court and the High Court are equally justified in coming to the conclusion that the accused had not delivered the possession of the land to the contractor till quite late as would appear from the letter of P.W. 8 dated the 5th April, 1963",1
5,We are aware of the argument addressed before us that some of the witnesses had said that the water channels had been closed in February 1963 and therefore no crop could thereafter have been standing on the land and must have been destroyed,1
5,"There is also the further argument that some of the statements recorded by the Military authorities were not taken into account, as the High Court had thought that since the deponents denied the contents the officers who recorded the statement might have been called to show that they were properly recorded",1
5,The learned advocate for the respondent also tried to support the stand taken by the High Court,1
5,It 1is true that when a witness has admitted having signed his previous statements that is enough to prove that some statement of his was recorded and he had appended his signature thereto,1
5,"The only question is, what use can be made of such statements even where the witness admits having signed the statements made before the Military Authorities",1
5,They can at best be used to contradict in the cross-examination of such a witness when he gives evidence at the Trial Court of the accused in the manner provided under Section 145 of 'the Evidence Act,0
5,"If it is intended to 'contradict the'- witness by the writing, the attention of the witness should be called before the writing can be proved to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him",1
5,"If this is not done, the evidence of the witnesses cannot be assailed in respect of those statements by merely proving that the witness had signed the document",1
5,"When the witnesses are contradicted by their previous statements in the manner aforesaid, then that part of the statements which has been put to the witness will be considered along with the evidence to assess the worth of the witness in determining his veracity",1
5,The whole of the previous statement however cannot be treated as substantive evidence,1
5,We do not find that the assessment of the evidence by the Trial Court and the High Court even in the light of such of those previous statements that have been put to the witnesses in the manner stated above is in any way unjustified,1
5,"It is said that some of the documents i.e. Ex. 8, 10 and 11 have not been put to the witnesses even though the Court relied upon them",1
5,P.8,1
5,as already noticed is the letter of Telu Ram Jain to the Assistant Garrison Engineer and P. 10 is the letter of Telu Ram Jain to the Garrison Engineer,1
5,Both these related to possession of the acquired land not being given to him,1
5,In the examination of the accused under Section 342 the Special Judge in our view did put all the circumstances against the accused which formed the basis of the conviction,1
5,"He was asked about the symbolic delivery of possession, the handing over of the actual possession of the land on 13-2-63 and the existence of crops on the date when possession was delivered on 16-2- 63",1
5,He was asked about Telu Ram's evidence and also that he had given possession of the land RD 1200 to RD 00 to the contractor after the crop had been cut,1
5,The letter Ex. P. 13 was also put to him and he was asked about the existence of the crops,1
5,"It cannot, therefore be said that circumstances appearing against the accused which have formed the basis of the conviction had not been put to him",1
5,The appellant has denied that there was any standing crop on the land acquired on any date after 13-2-63,1
5,"On the other hand, he emphatically asserted that at the time when the possession was delivered to him on 13-2-63 there was also no crops standing on the acquired land",1
5,This statement is clearly false as it is against credible documentary evidence at a time when there was no possibility of any charge being levied against the appellant,1
5,"It is also incorrect because the ,contractor did not work on the acquired land since 1-2- 63 that position is reflected in the review report initiated by the A.G.E. on 9-2-63 (vide Ex. DQ",1
5,"The appellant's statement is therefore belied by the documentary evidence which shows unmistakably that there was on 13-2-63 bumper crops of different varieties standing,on the land which was valued thereafter and compensation assessed",1
5,We do not therefore think that there is any justification in the criticism that circumstances appearing in the several documents have not been put to him,1
5,"It is lastly contended that certain witnesses who would be necessary to unfold the prosecution story have not been called and.in spite of the Court directing the production, of the usufruct register it was not produced",2
5,These omissions it is submitted by the learned advocate has prejudiced the accused,2
5,"As the learned advocate for the respondent rightly pointed out with reference to each one of the persons who, it was claimed, should have been called, that there was already evidence relating to the particular matter about which the person specified was sought to be called",1
5,"For instance, it is said that Gamkhar, Military Estate officer was not produced to prove the receipt Ex",1
5,P. 24,1
5,But this was not necessary because Gamkhar was not present nor did he sign the receipt,1
5,The person who had signed the receipt is Sukhchain Lal Jain and he was examined as P.W. 11,1
5,"Similarly, it is said that the Tehsildar N. L. Handa has not been produced",1
5,But when the prosecution relies upon the proof of Ex,1
5,P. 24 as also to establish that there was standing crops on the land when the possession was delivered on 13-2-63 on certain witnesses who were present on the respective occasions,1
5,the nonexamination of other witnesses without anything more cannot be treated as defect in the prosecution,1
5,Before the High Court also this grievance was aired but that Court also likewise found no justification in it,1
5,We are therefore not impressed with this argument,1
5,"On' a careful consideration of the evidence both oral and documentary it is established that the Appellant who was in charge of the expansion work on the air-strip was given possession of the land acquired for that purpose on 13-2-63, that there was standing thereon, a bumper crop of Sarson, gram and Lusan on that day, that he was therefore entrusted with this crop, that he postponed giving delivery of the land to the contractor till, at any rate after the 23rd March, 1963 and before the 6th April, 1963 and that he allowed the crop to be cut and taken away without in any way accounting for it which shows that it was done dishonestly and raudulently",4
5,"The fact that otwithstanding overwhelming evidence particularly of his own admission at the time he denies that there were ever any crops when delivery of possession of the land acquired was taken by him, further reinforces the conclusion that he allowed the crops to be cut away with dishonest or fraudulent motive",4
5,We do not think in these circumstances there is any justification whatever for interfering with the concurrent findings of the Trial Court and the High Court that the Appellant is guilty of an offence under Section 5(1)(c) read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and consequently the appeal is dismissed,4
5,Appeal dismissed,4
8,"This appeal by special leave which is directed against the judgment and order dated April 24,1974 of the Letters Patent Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Madras reversing the judgment and order dated April 19,1971 of the Single Judge of that Court passed in writ petition No.3822 of 1969 presented u/art.226 of the Constitution raises a complex but an interesting question relating to the construction of the phrases ""maternity benefit........for the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and for the six weeks immediately following that day"" occurring in s.5(1) of the Maternity Benefits Act,1961",6
8,Act LIII of 1961) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') which in view of s.2(1) of the Act is the law applicable even to women workers employed in plantations,6
8,"It appears that in October,1967,Subbammal,respondent No.2 herein,who is a woman worker employed in Mount Stuart Estate (hereinafter referred to as 'the establishment'),which is carrying on plantation industry,was allowed leave of absence by the establishment on the basis of a notice given by her of her expected delivery which actually took place on December 16,1967.After her delivery,the respondent was paid by her employers on account of maternity benefit an amount equivalent to what she would have earned on the basis of her average daily wage in 72 working days falling within twelve week's of the maternity period",6
8,"While calculating the aforesaid amount of maternity benefit,the establishment admittedly excluded twelve Sundays being wageless holidays,which fell during the period of the respondent's actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and the six weeks immediately following that day",6
8,"Dissatisfied with this computation,the respondent made a representation to her employers claiming maternity benefit for the entire period of twelve weeks under the Act.i.e.for 84 days on the plea that a week consisted of seven days",6
8,"As her demand did not evoke a favourable response,the respondent applied to the Labour Court,Coimbatore,under section 33C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act for redress of her grievance",6
8,"The claim preferred by the respondent was resisted by the appellant herein who contended that the respondent was admittedly working and was being paid only for six days in a week and that a pregnant woman worker is entitled to maternity benefit for 72 days which are the normal working days in twelve weeks and not for 84 days,as no wage is payable for the seventh day of the week i.e",6
8,"Sunday,which is a nonworking wageless holiday",6
8,"By its order dated February 26,1969,the Labour Court allowed the claim of the respondent",6
8,Thereupon the establishment moved the High Court at Madras u,6
8,"art.226 of the Constitution challenging the,decision of the Labour Court",6
8,contending that the claim made by the respondent was untenable as normally a worker works only for six days in a week and the maternity benefit had to be computed only for 72 days,6
8,"As against this,the respondent pleaded that the computation had to be made not with reference to the Actual number of working days but with reference to total number of days covered by twelve weeks i.e.84 days",6
8,The Single Judge of the High Court to whom the case was assigned allowed the petition holding that twelve weeks for which maternity benefit is provided for in subs.(3) of s.5 of the Act must be taken to mean twelve weeks of work and the computation of the benefit had to be made with reference to the Actual days on which the woman would have worked but for her inability,6
8,"Aggrieved by this decision,the respondent filed an appeal u/cl.15 of the Letters Patent which,as already stated,was allowed by the Letters Patent Bench of the High Court observing that the maternity benefit which the respondent was entitled to receive was for the period of her absence before delivery including the day of delivery and also six weeks thereafter,each week consisting of seven days including Sundays",6
8,"Dissatisfied with this decision,the establishment has,already stated,come up in appeal to this Court by special leave",6
8,We have heard Mr,6
8,"Pai,learned counsel for the appellant as also Mr",6
8,"Bhatt,who in view of the default in appearance of respondent No.2 and the importance of the point involved in the case was appointed as amicus cruaie",6
8,We place on record our deep appreciation of the valuable assistance rendered to us by both of them,6
8,"Assailing the judgment and order under appeal,Mr",2
8,"Pai has urged that since legislative intent,as revealed from the scheme of s.5(1) of the Act is to compensate the woman worker who expects delivery for the loss that her forced absence from work on account of pregnancy and confinement may entail,the liability which has to be imposed on her employer cannot exceed the amount that she would have earned if she had not been compelled to avail of the maternity leave and since Sunday is a non-working wageless day,the employer cannot be made to pay for that day",2
8,"He has further urged that since u/s.5 (1) of the Act,the maternity benefit has to be computed with reference to the period of the workers' actual absence thereby meaning absence on days on which there was work excluding Sundays and the term 'week"" in the context of 'sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the Act is to be under stood as a week of work consisting of six days and in the instant case,respondent No.2 was working and earning wages for six days in a week,the seventh day being a wageless holiday,her claim cannot be sustained",2

8,"For a proper determination of the question involved in the appeal,it would,we think,be useful to refer to certain provisions of the Act which have a bearing on the subject matter of the controversy before US",1
8,"s.2(1) of the Act makes the Act applicable to every establishment being a factory,mine or plantation (including any such establishment belonging to Government and to every establishment wherein persons are employed for the exhibition of equastrain acrobatic and other performance",0
8,"Sub-s.(2) of s.2 of the Act specifically excludes the applicability of the provisions of the Act to any factory or other establishment to which the provisions of the Employees State Insurance Act,1948 apply for the time being.s.3(n) of the Act defines ""wages"" as under :- ""3(n).--Wages means all remuneration paid or payable in cash to a woman,if the terms of the contract of employment,express or implied,were fulfilled and includes- (1) such cash allowances (including dearness allowance and house rent allowance) as a woman is for the time being entitled to",0
8,"2) incentive bonus; and (3) the money value of the concessional supply of food-grains and other articles,but does not include",0
8,i) any bonus other than incentive bonus; (ii) over-time earnings and any deduction or payment on account of fines; (iii) any contribution paid or payable by the employer to any pension fund or provident fund or for the benefit of the woman under any law for the time being in force; and (iv) any gratuity payable on the termination of service,0
8,"The above definition,it would be noted,does not restrict the meaning of the term ""wages"" to contractual wages but gives the term a composite meaning covering all remunerations in the nature of cash allowances,incentive bonus and the money value of the concessional supply of foodgrains and other articles",1
8,"S.4 of the Act which prohibits the employment of,or work by,woman during certain period lays down :- ""4.Employment of,or work by,woman prohibited during certain period.- (1) No employer shall knowingly employ a woman in any establishment during the six weeks immediately following the day of her delivery or her mis-carriage",0
8,No woman shall work in any establishment during the six weeks immediately following the day of her delivery or miscarriage,0
8,"3) Without prejudice to the provisions of section 6,no pregnant woman shall,on a request being made by her in this behalf,be required by her employer to do during the period specified in sub-s.(4) any which is of an arduous nature or which involves long hours of standing,or which in any way is likely to interfere with her pregnancy or the normal development of the foetus,or is likely to cause her miscarriage or otherwise to adversely affect her health",0
8,The period referred to in sub-s.(3) shall be- (a,0

8,EXPLANATION,0
8,"For the purpose of this sub-section,the average daily wage means the average of the woman's wages payable to her for the days on which she has worked during the period of three calendar months immediately preceding the date from which she absents herself on account of maternity,or one rupee a day,whichever is higher",0
8,"No woman shall be entitled to maternity benefit unless she has actually worked in an establishment of the employer from whom she claims maternity benefit,for a period of not less than one hundred and sixty days in the twelve months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery",0
8,Provided that the qualifying period of one hundred and sixty days aforesaid shall not apply to a woman who has immigrated into the State of Assam and was pregnant at the time of the immigration,0
8,"For the purpose of calculating under this sub-section,the days on which a woman has actually worked in the establishment,the days for which she has been laid off during the period of twelve months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery shall be taken into account",0
8,"The maximum period for which any woman shall be entitled to maternity benefit shall be twelve weeks,that is to say,six weeks up to and including the day of her delivery and six weeks immediately following that day",0
8,"Provided that where a woman dies during this period,the maternity benefit shall be payable only for the days up to and including the day of her death",0
8,"Provided further that where a woman,having delivered of a child,dies during her delivery or during the period of six weeks immediately following the date of her delivery,leaving behind in either case the child,the employer shall be liable for the maternity benefit for the entire period of six weeks immediately following the day of her delivery but if the child also dies during the said period,then,for the days upto and including the day of the death of the child",0
8,"S.6 of the Act which deals with notice of claim for maternity benefit and payment thereof is to the following effect :- ""6.Notice of claim for maternity benefit and payment thereof",0
8,"Any woman employed in an establishment and entitled to maternity benefit under the provisions of this Act may give notice in writing in such form as may be prescribed,to her employer,stating that her maternity benefit and any other amount to which she may be entitled under this Act may be paid to her or to such person as she may nominate in the notice and that she will not work in any establishment during the period for which she receives' maternity benefit",0
8,"In the case of a woman who is pregnant,such notice shall state the date from which she will be absent from work,not being a date earlier than six weeks from the date of her expected delivery",0
8,3) Any woman who has not given the notice when she was pregnant may give such notice as soon as possible after the delivery,0
8,"On receipt of the notice,the employer shall permit such woman to absent herself from the establishment until the expiry of six weeks after the day of her delivery",0
8,"The amount of maternity benefit for the period preceding the date of her expected delivery shall be paid in advance by the employer to the woman on production of such proof as may be prescribed that the woman is pregnant,and the amount due for the subsequent period shall be paid by the employer to.the woman within forty-eight hours of production of such proof as may be prescribed that the woman has been delivered of a child",0
8,"6) The failure to give notice under this section s not disentitle a woman to maternity benefit or any other amount under this Act if she is otherwise entitled to such benefit or amount and in any such case,an Inspector may either of his own motion or on an application made to him by the woman,order the payment of such benefit of amount within such period as may be specified in the order",0
8,The provisions of s.5 of the Act quoted above make it clear that a woman worker who expects a child is entitled to maternity benefit for a maximum period of twelve weeks which is split up into two periods viz.prenatal and post-natal,1
8,The first one i.e.prenatal or ante-natal period is limited to the period of woman's actual absence extending upto six weeks immediately preceding and including the day on which her delivery occurs and the second one which is postnatal compulsory period consists of six weeks immediately following the day of delivery,1
8,The benefit has to be calculated for the aforesaid two periods on the basis of the average daily wage,1
8,"According to the Explanation appended to s.5(1) of the Act,the average daily wage has to be computed taking into consideration the average of the woman's wager,.payable to her for the days on which she has worked during the period of three calendar months immediately preceding the date from which she absents herself on account of maternity,or one rupee a day,whichever is higher",0
8,"For fixing the average daily wage,it has therefore first to be ascertained whether the wages with were paid or were payable to the woman was for 'time work' or for 'piece work'.It has next to be ascertained as to what were the cash wages paid or payable to her in terms of the definition contained in s.3 (n) of the Act for the days on which she worked during the period of three-calendar months immediately preceding the date of delivery,reckoned according to the British calendar month",1
8,The total wages thus worked out are to be divided by the number of days in the aforesaid three calendar months in order to arrive at the average daily wage,1
8,"After thus finding out the average daily wage,the liability of the employer in respect of the maternity benefit has to be calculated in terms of s.5 of the Act for both ore-natal and post-natal period indicated above",1
8,"The real though difficult question that calls for determination by us is as to what is the connotation of the term ""week"" occurring in sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the Act and whether the computation of the maternity benefit prescribed by the Act for the a foresaid two periods has to be made taking a ""week"" as signifying a cycle of seven days including a Sunday or a cycle of seven days minus a Sunday which is said to be a wageless day,As the Act does not contain any definition of the word ""week"",it has to be understood in its ordinary dictionary sense",1
8,"In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Third Edition),the word ""week"" has been described as meaning ""the cycle of seven days,recognized in the calendar of the Jews and thence adopted in the calendars of Christian Mohammedan and various other peoples",1
8,"A space of seven days,irrespective of the time from which it is reckoned",1
8,"Seven days as a term for periodical payments (of wager,,rent,or the like),or as a unit of reckoning for time of work or service",1
8,"In Webster's New World Dictionary (1962 Edition),the meaning of the word ""week"" is given as ""a period of seven days,especially one beginning with Sunday and ending with Saturday; the hours or days of work in a seven-day period",1
8,"In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (Third Edition),it is stated that (1) ""though a week usually means any consecutive seven days,it will sometimes be interpreted to mean the ordinary notion of a week reckoning from Sunday to Sunday and (2) probably,a week usually means seven clear days",1
8,"A ""week"" according to Halsbury's Laws of England",1
8,"Third Edi-tion) Volume 37 at p.84 is.strictly the time between midnight on Saturday and the same hour on the next succeeding Saturday,but the term is also applied to any period of seven successive days",1
8,Bearing in mind the above mentioned dictionary or popular meaning of the term,1
8,"week"",we think that in the context of sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the Act,the term has to be taken to signify a cycle of seven days including Sundays",1
8,"The language in which the aforesaid sub-s.s are couched also shows that the Legislature intended that computation of maternity benefit is to be made for the entire period of the woman worker's actual absence i.e.for all the days including Sundays which may be wageless holidays falling within that period and not only for intermittent periods of six days thereby excluding Sundays falling within that period for if it were not so,the Legislature instead of using the words ""for the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and for the six weeks immediately following that day"" would have used the words ""for the working days falling within the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and the six weeks immediately following that day but excluding the wageless days"".Again the word ""period"" occurring in s.5(1) of the Act is a strong word",1
8,"It seems to emphasize,in our judgment,the continuous running of time and recurrence of the cycle of seven days",1
8,"It has also to be borne in mind in this connection that in interpreting provisions of beneficial pieces of legislation like the one in hand which is intended to achieve the object of doing social justice to women workers employed in the plantations and which squarely fall within the purview of Art.42 of the Constitution,the beneficent rule of construction which would enable the woman worker not only to subsist but also to make up her dissipated energy,nurse her child,preserve her efficiency as a worker and maintain the level of her previous efficiency and output has to be adopted by the Court",1
8,The interpretation placed by us on the phraseology of sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the Act appears to us to be in conformity not only with the legislative intendment but also with Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Art.4 of Convention No.103 concerning Maternity Protection Convention,0
8,"Revised),1952 adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation which are extracted below for facility of reference:- ""Art.4",0
8,"1.While absent from work on maternity leave in accordance with the provisions of art.3,the woman shall be entitled to receive cash and medical benefits",0
8,2.The rates of cash benefit shall be fixed by national laws or regulations so as to ensure benefit sufficient for the full and healthy maintenance of herself and her child in according with a suitable standard of living,0
8,Thus we are of opinion that computation of maternity benefit has to be made for all the days including Sundays and rest days which may be wageless holidays comprised in the Actual period of absence of the woman extending upto six weeks preceding and including the day of delivery as also for all the days falling within the six weeks immediately following the day of delivery thereby ensuring that the woman worker gets for the said period not only the amount equalling 100 per cent of the wages which she was previously earning in terms of s.3 (n) of the Act but also the benefit of the wages for all the Sundays and rest days falling within the aforesaid two periods which would ultimately be conducive to the interests of both the woman worker and her employer,4
8,"In view of what we have stated above,we cannot uphold the view of the law expressed by the Full Bench of Kerala High Court in Malayalam Plantations Ltd",1

9,"The main question raised in this appeal by special leave at the instance of State,of Gujarat,and the Collector of Sabarkantha against the Gujarat High Court's judgment and order dated January 30/31,1975 allowing the writ petition of the respondent is whether once the competent authority under s.2(4) (i) of the Bombay Merged Territories and Areas (Jagirs Abolition",1
9,"Act,1953 (Bombay Act",1
9,"No.XXXIX of 1954) declares that a particular Jagir is a proprietary one,a further inquiry under s.37 (2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code (Bombay Act",1
9,No,1
9,"V of 1879) with a view to determining whether the Jagirdar had any rights to mines or mineral products in his Jagir granted or recognised under any contract,grant or law for the time being in force or by custom or usage is competent",1
9,"The facts giving rise to the said question are these : By Hajur Order No.116 dated October 27,1933,the respondent (Maharaj Shri Amar Singji Himatsingji) was granted Daljitgarh Jagir comprising of 10 villages mentioned in the said order in jivarak (for maintenance) by the then Ruler of Idar; by another Hajur Order No.807 dated January 12,1934,the respondent was given a further grant in jivarak of 3 villages mentioned in that order with effect from October 1,1933; by yet another Hajur Order No.964 dated November 21,1947,14 villages (including Kapoda and Isarwada) were granted in jivarak to the respondent by the Ruler of Idar in substitution of the villages mentioned in the previous two orders",6
9,"According to the respondent by these grants (parvanas) read together he was given full proprietary rights in the soil of the said villages,that is to say,it was a proprietary Jagir that was granted to him by the then Ruler",6
9,"Admittedly,on the coming into force of the Bombay Merged Territories and Areas (Jagirs Abolition) Act,1953 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act"") i.e.with effect from respondent's Daljitgarh Jagir stood abolished and all his rights in the Jagir villages,save as expressly provided by or under the Act,were extinguished and the respondent became entitled to compensation under s.11 of the Act",6
9,"It appears that for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the Act the competent authority (Collector of District Sabarkantha) held an inquiry into the question whether the respondent's Jigir was proprietary (involving any right or interest in the soil) or non-proprietary (involving mere assignment of land revenue or rent due to Government) under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act and having regard to the documentary and other evidence led before it,the competent authority by its order dated September 8,1959,held that the Daljitgarh Jagir of the respondent was a proprietary jagir",6
9,"It further appears that pursuant to an order dated November 24,1959,passed by the Mamlatdar,Idar,an entry was made on June 18,1963,in the relevant revenue records (village Form No.6) of one of the villages Kapoda comprised in the Jagir to the effect that the respondent's right to take out gravel and stones was recognised but the right relating to excavation of mica had been reserved and retained by the Government; this entry was only certified on March 30,1965.According to the respondent since the entries made in the revenue records in respect of his rights to mines and mineral products were not sufficient and proper and though the Mamlatdar's order dated November 24,1959 was in respect of two villages,namely,Kapoda and Isarwada,the relevant entry in respect of greval and stones had been made only in regard to village Kapoda,he by his application dated October 11,1968,requested the Collector,Sabarkantha,to issue necessary orders to the Mamlatdar,Idar,to make appropriate entries regarding his rights in the minerals in village Isarwada",6
9,"A similar application,containing similar request,was also made by the respondent to the Mamlatdar Taluka Idar on October 4,1971.Thereupon a notice under S.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code for the purpose of holding an inquiry into the rights of the respondent to mines and mineral products of the said villages claimed by the respondent wag served upon him but the respondent raised a preliminary objection that such inquiry wag misconceived and incompetent in view of the determination made under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act and having regard to the provisions of S.10 of the Act-his rights,to mines and mineral products were expressly saved; the Collector of Sabarkantha (appellant No.2) overruled the preliminary objection and by order dated February 23,1973,directed that the inquiry shall proceed and the respondent was directed to produce his evidence in support of his claim on a date that would be fixed and intimated to him",6
9,"Aggrieved by this order passed by the Collector on February 23,1973,the respondent preferred a writ petition (Special Civil Application No.1224 of 1973) under Art.227 of the Constitution to the,Gujarat High Court and writ of certiorari quashing the order dated February 23,1973 and a direction restraining the Collector from further proceeding with the inquiry under S.37(2) of the Land Revenue Code were sought",6
9,These reliefs sought by the respondent were resisted by the State of Gujarat and the Collector (the appellants before us) principally on the ground that the inquiry under s.37(2) of the Land Revenue Code into the rights to mines and mineral products in the said villages claimed by the respondent was necessary and proper and could not be said to-be concluded by the determination made under s.2 (4) (1) of the Act by the competent authority,6
9,"The High Court negatived the contentions urged by the appellants and took the view that in the determination by the competent authority under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act that the respondent's Jagir was a proprietary one there was implicit decision that the respondent was a grantee of the soil which included sub-soil entitling him to mines and mineral products and as such a further inquiry by the Collector under S.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code was incompetent and without jurisdiction and,therefore,the Collector's order dated February 23,1973 was liable to be quashed",3
9,"Accordingly,the High Court set aside the Collector's order and further issued an injunction permanently restraining the State of Gujarat and the Collector from initiating any inquiry under S.37(2) in respect of the respondents rights to mines and mineral products in the said villages",3
9,The appellants seek to challenge the said judgment and order of the Gujarat High Court in this appeal,6
9,"Learned counsel for the appellants has contended that the High Court has adopted an erroneous view of the scope and ambit of the inquiry contemplated under S.2(4)(i) of the Act by the competent authority in as much as under the said provision the competent authority had power merely to decide the question whether the respondents Jagir was a proprietary or a non-proprietary Jagir and had no Dower or jurisdiction to determine whether on the appointed date that is on August 1,1954 when the Act,came into force the respondent had subsisting rights to mines and minerals products in the Jagir villages so as to be saved under S.10 of the Act",2
9,He urged that it would be for the Collector acting under S.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code to decide the latter question in an inquiry initiated under that provision,2
9,According to learned counsel the mere circumstance that the respondent's Jagir was found under S.2(4,2
9,"i) to be proprietary was not tantamount to the establishment by the respondent of his rights to mines and mineral products in the villages of his Jagir for which there must be an actual grant or contract or law or custom or usage recognising such rights and this could only be determined by the Collector by holding an inquiry under s.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code,and,therefore the High Court was clearly in error in coming to the conclusion that the inquiry initiated by the second appellant under s.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code,was incompetent or without jurisdiction",2
9,"On the other hand,learned counsel for the respondent contended that a determination under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act that a particular Jagir 'was a proprietary one necessarily implied that the grant was of soil and the grantee was entitled to mines and mineral products which were expressly saved under s.10 of the Act and in any event on the facts obtaining in the instant case the competent authority acting under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act,while coming to the conclusion that the respondent's Jagir was proprietary one,bad relied upon the unqualified nature of the grant and also considered the evidence led before it touching upon the several rights such as right to sell fire-wood,babul trees,saltrees,timru trees,right to sell agriculture land and house sites; right to sell stones and gravel,right to sell or allow use of land for manufacture of bricks-enjoyed by the respondent since the time the grant had been made in his favour by the then Ruler and it was on the basis of such evidence that tile competent authority had come to the conclusion that the respondent's Jagir was a proprietary one",2
9,"He urged that having regard to such determination that was made by the competent authority under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act it would be clear that a further inquiry into the respondent's rights to mines and mineral products,particularly gravel and stones under s.37(2) of the Code would be misconceived and incompetent",2
9,"He pointed out that presumably pursuant to this determination,the Mamlatdar,Idar,had passed an order on November 24,1959,that the respondent's right to stones and gravel in the two villages of Kapoda and Isarwada,though not to mica,had been recognised by the Government and accordingly the necessary entry pertaining to respondent's right to stones and gravel had been made in the relevant revenue records at least in the case of village Kapoda and had been duly certified",2
9,"He further urged that the two letters addressed by the respondent-one to the Collector on October 11,1968 and the other to the Mamlatdar on October 4,1971,merely contained a request to make appropriate entries in the Revenue Records based on the Mamlatdar's order dated November 24,1959 and,therefore,the Collector could not pronounce upon those letters as containing a claim put forward by the respondent for the first time to mines and mineral products in the said Jagir villages to initiate an inquiry under s.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue de",2
9,"According to the learned counsel for the respondent unless a claim to property or rights over property was Made either by the State against any person or by any person against the State,there could be no occasion for the Collector to held an inquiry contemplated by s.37(2) of the Code",2
9,"He,therefore,urged that the High Court was right in quashing the Collector's order dated February 23,1973",2
9,"Having regard to the rival contentions of the parties summarised above,it will appear clear that really two questions-one general and the other specific in the light of the facts obtaining in the instant case,arise for our determination in this appeal",1
9,The general question is whether once the competent authority under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act declares that the particular Jagir is a proprietary one a further inquiry under s.37(2) of the Land Revenue Code with a view to determining whether the Jagirdar had rights to mines and mineral products in such Jagir subsisting on the appointed date is competent,1
9,The other specific question is whether in the facts of the case and having regard to the nature of evidence considered and the specific finding made by the competent authority while determining the question under s.2(4,1
9,"i),the further inquiry initiated by the Collector under s.37(2) was misconceived and uncalled for",1
9,"Dealing with the first question which is of a general character,it is clear that the answer thereto depends upon the true scope and ambit of the inquiry under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act and to determine the same it will be necessary to consider the scheme and object of the Act and.in particular the purpose of the said inquiry",1
9,"The enactment as its preamble will show,has been put on the Statute Book with a view to abolishing Jagirs of various kinds in the merged territories and merged areas in the State of Bombay and to provide for matters consequential and incidental thereto",1
9,"S.2 contains the definitions of various expressions some of which are material.s.2(vi) defines the expression ""jagir"" as meaning the grant by or recognition as a grant by,the ruling authority for the time being before the merger of a village,whether such grant is of the soil or an assignment of land revenue or both; there is also an inclusive part of definition with which we are not concerned",0
9,"S.2(vii) defines ""jagirdar"" as meaning a holder of a jagir village and includes his co-sharer.S.2(xv) defines ""nonproprietary Jagir"" as meaning a jagir which consists of a right in the jagirdar to appropriate as incident of the jagir,land revenue or rent due to Government from persons holding land in a jagir village,but which does not consist of any right or interest in the soil",0
9,"S.2(xviii) defines ""proprietary jagir"" as meaning a jagir in respect of which the jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement or by custom or usage is entitled to any rights or interest in the soil",0
9,"S.2(4),though it forms part of a definition section,contains a substantive provision which is material for our purposes and it runs thus: ""2(4",0
9,If any question arises,0
9,"i) whether a jagir is proprietary or non-proprietary, (ii)whether any land is Ghatked or Jiwai,or (iii)whetherany person is a permanent holder",0
9,the State Government shall decide the question and such decision shall be final,0
9,"Provided that the State Government may authorise any officer to decide questions arising under any of the subclauses(i),(ii) and (iii) and subject to 'an appeal to the State Government,his decision shall 'be final",0
9,"Section 3,which contains the main provision dealing with abolition of jagirs,provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any usage,grant,sanad,order,agreement or any law for the time being in force,on and from the appointed date (which under S.2 (1) (i) is a date on which the Act comes into force,which is August 1,1954),all jagirs shall be deemed to have been abolished and save as expressly provided by or under the provisions of this Act,the right of a jagirdar to recover rent or assessment of land or to levy or recover any kind of tax,cess,fee,charge or any hak and the right of reversion or lapse if any,vested in a jagirdar,and all other rights of a jagirdar or of any person legally subsisting on the said date-,in respect of a jagir village as incidents of jagir shall be deemed to have been extinguished",0
9,"As a consequence of the,abolition of jagirs under s.3 all Jagir villages became unalienated villages and,therefore,under s.4 it has been provided that all Jagir villages shall be liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the Code and the Rules made thereunder and the provisions of the Code and the Rules relating to unalienated land shall apply to such villages",0
9,"Ss.5 and 6 make provision as to what persons,upon abolition of jagirs and conversion of jagir land into unalienated land would be occupants,who shall be primarily liable to the State Government for payment of land revenue",0
9,"S.8 declares that all public roads,lands,paths,bridges,titches,dikes,and fences,on or besides the same,the bed of the sea and of harbours,creeks below high water mark,and of rivers,streams,nalaps lakes,wells and tanks,and all canals and water courses etc,situated in jagir village shall vest in the State Government and shall be deemed to be the property of the State Government and all rights held by such jagirdars in such property shall be deemed to have been extinguished.s.10 contains an express saving provision relating to rights to mines and mineral products and it provides that ""nothing in this Act or any other law for the time being in force,shall be deemed to affect the rights of any jagirdar subsisting on the appointed date to mines or mineral products in a jagir village granted or recognised under any contract.,grant or law for the time being in force or by custom or usage",0
9,"s.11 (1) provides for the quantum of compensation payable to a non-proprietary jagirdar on account of abolition of his jagir and extinguishment of his rights,while s.11(2) makes similar provision for quantum of compensation to a proprietary jagirdar on account of the abolition of 'his jagir and extinguishment of his rights",0
9,Ss.13 and 14 provide for methods of awarding compensations to jagirdars by the Collector and against the awards of the Collector under either of these provisions a appeal has been provided at the instance of the aggrieved party to the Revenue Tribunal under s.16.S.17 provides the procedure for disposal of appeals by the Revenue Tribunal while s.18 prescribes a period of limitation for preferring such appeals and s.20 gives finality to the award made by the Collector subject to appeal to the Revenue Tribunal,0
9,The rest of the sections are (if formal character and not material for our purposes,0
9,The aforesaid survey of the material provisions of the Act will bring out two or three aspects very clearly,1
9,"In the first place the,preamble and s.3 of the Act clearly show that the object of the enactment is to abolish Jagirs of all kinds in the merged territories and merged areas in the State of Bombay and to convert all Jagir villages into unalienated villages liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the Bombay Land Revenue Code",1
9,"Secondly,compensation is made payable under S.11 of the Act to Jagirdars whose Jagirs and other incidental rights have been extinguished but it will be pertinent to note that no provision has been made for payment of compensation in respect of rights to mines and mineral products in a Jagir village,obviously because if by the grant in question the Jagirdar has not been given any rights to mines and mineral products no compensation would be payable and if there be a grant of mines and mineral products the same have been saved ""to the Jagirdar under S.10 of the Act",1
9,"Thirdly,the quantum of compensation payable for abolition of Jagir and extinguishment of his other rights depends upon what kind of Jagir has been abolished,whether it is proprietary or non-proprietary; in other words it is clear that the inquiry into the nature of the Jagir under s.2 (4) (i) is for the purpose of determining the quantum of compensation payable to a Jagirdar inasmuch as in the case of.a non-proprietary Jagir the Jagirdar is entitled to compensation at the rate of three times the amount of land revenue received by or due to him as an incident of Jagir during the five years immediately before the appointed date under S.11 (1),while in the case of a proprietary Jagir in respect of land held by a permanent holder the Jagirdar is entitled to compensation equivalent to three multiples of the assessment fixed for such land; S.11(3) provides for compensation and computation thereof to a Jagirdar having any right or interest in any property referred to in S.8.In such an inquiry ordinarily no determination of any rights of the Jagirdar to mines or mineral products in a Jagir village will be undertaken for' no compensation is payable in respect of any rights to mines and mineral products in a Jagir village",1
9,"There is yet one more aspect emerging from the definition of the expression ""proprietary jagir"" which leads to the same inference.""Proprietary jagir"" has been defined in S.2(xviii) to mean a jagir in respect of which the Jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement or by custom or usage is entitled to any rights or interest in the soil",1
9,"In other words,the competent authority holding an inquiry under s.2(4) (i) can come to the conclusion that a particular Jagir is proprietary if it finds that the Jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement is entitled to some rights or interest in the soil other than mines or mineral products",1
9,"These aspects bring out true scope and ambit of the inquiry under sec.2(4)(i) and clearly show that the determination of the question whether a Jagir is proprietary or nonproprietary does not necessarily involve the determination of the question whether the Jagirdar had any rights to mines and mineral products on the appointed date.it is true that prima facie the owner of the surface of the land would be entitled to everything beneath the land and ordinarily mines and mineral products would pass with the right to the surface but this would be so in the absence of any reservations made in the grant; if there be reservations or qualifications in regard to mines or mineral products,in the grant,then these would not pass",1
9,"In this case also notwithstanding the alleged unqualified grant in favour of the respondent the Mamladar's order dated November 24,1959,on which the respondent strongly relies,has held that the rights to excavate mica were retained by the State and not granted to the respondent,though the material or basis on which it is so held is not available on the record",1
9,"It is,therefore,not possible to accept the contention of learned counsel for the respondents that a determination under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act to the effect that a particular Jagir is a proprietary one necessarily implies that the grantee is entitled to mines and mineral products in the villages comprised in the grant,especially ,when having regard to the definition given in s.2(xviii) a Jagir could be proprietary without a right to mines and mineral products",1
9,"In other words,our answer to the general question raised above would be that even after the competent authority has declared a particular Jagir to be a proprietary one under s.2(4",1
9,"i) of the Act,a further inquiry under s.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code into the question whether a Jagirdar had any subsisting rights to mines and mineral products in the Jagir villages on the appointed date would be competent unless the grant of a right to mines and mineral products ,or the actual enjoyment thereof in keeping with the grant happens to ,be the basis of the,determination under s.2 (4) (1 ) of the Act",1
9,"Turning to the other specific question raised by counsel for the respondent before us we are clearly of the view that in the facts and circumstances of the case the inquiry initiated by the Collector under s.37(4) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code will have to be regarded as incompetent,misconceived and uncalled for",1
9,The main valid objection to the said inquiry is that the condition precedent the existence of which canlead to the initiation of such inquiry is absent here,1
9,"S.37(1) of the Code contains the well-known declaratory provision where under all public roads,lanes and paths,the bridges,ditches,dikes,beds of the sea,harbours and creeks below high-water-mark,and of rivers,streams,nallas,lakes and tanks etc.and all lands wherever situated,which are not the property of individuals,are declared to be,with all rights in or over the same,or appertaining thereto,the property of the Crown; then follows sub-s.(2) which is material and it runs thus: ""37(2",0
9,"Where any property or any right in or over any property is claimed by or on behalf of the Crown or by any person as against the Crown,it shall be lawful for the Collector or a survey officer,after formal inquiry of which due notice has been given,to pass an order deciding the claim",0
9,"Under sub-s.(3),the decision of the Collector under sub-s.(2) is rendered final subject to the result of a suit that is required to be instituted in a Civil Court within one year of the said",0
9,"decision.on a reading of sub-s.(2),which we have quoted above,it will appear clear that laying a claim to a property or any right in or over the property either by the State against an individual or by the individual ,against the State is a condition precedent to the Collector's power to hold an inquiry contemplated by that provision",0
9,"In other words,before the Collector can initiate an inquiry under that provision,either the State or the individual must put forward a claim to a property or any right in or over the property and it is such claim that is to be inquired into by the Collector whose decision,subject to a civil suit filed within one year,is rendered final",1
9,"The question in the instant case is whether the respondent by making the two applications,one dated October 11,1968 to the Collector of Sabarkantha and the other dated October 4,1971,to the Mamlatdar,Taluka Idar,could be said to have put forward or laid a claim to a right to excavate gravel and stone a particular mineral product-so as to afford an occasion for the Collector to initiate the inquiry",1
9,The material on record clearly shows that the respondent could not be said to have done so,1
9,"Admittedly,by his previous order dated November 24,1959,the Mamlatdar of Talukadar,had declared that the respondent had been granted all the rights,particularly the right to quarry and remove gravel and Stones,in Isarwada and Kapoda villages in the year 1947 by the Idar Stale and that thereafter in the years 1952 and 1953 the Jagirdar had taken the produce of stone and that,therefore,the Government could not stop him from ""taking out gravel and stones"" but that the rights to excavating mica had been retained by the State; further,pursuant to this 'order the appropriate entry had been made in the relevant village records (Form No.6) of village Kapoda on June 18,1963,recognising the respondents right to,take out gravel and stones,which entry was verified and confirmed on March 30,1965,it was in this situation that the respondent made the aforesaid two applications,one to the Collector,Sabarkantha and the other to the Mamladar Taluka Idar,whereby relying upon the previous order of the Mamlatdar dated November 24,1959,he requested that appropriate entries pertaining to his right to gravel and stones should be similarly made in respect of village Isarwada",6
9,"It is thus clear that by these two applications the respondent had not put forward any claim as such to excavating gravel and stones for the first time' but,had merely requested the making of appropriate entry with regard to his said right which had already been recognised by the State Government previously",1
9,"That being the position,there was no occasion for the Collector to initiate the inquiry under s.37(2) of the Code-in fact,he had no jurisdiction to do so,the condition precedent not being satisfied",1
9,"Moreover,having regard to the statement made by counsel for the respondent before us it would be unfair to subject the respondent to the further inquiry under s.37(2) of the Code",1
9,"We may state that Counsel for-the respondent categorically stated before the Court that his client was confining his right to excavating only one type of mineral product,namely,gravel and stones,and that too from only two villages,namely,Kapoda and Isarwada comprised in his Jagir,in regard to which the Mamlatdar's order dated November 24,1959,was quite clear and,therefore,he urged that the further inquiry under s.37(2) of the Code into that very right was misconceived and uncalled for",2
9,We find considerable force in this contention,1
9,"Besides,while determining the proprietary nature of the grant under s.2(4)(1) of the Act the competent authority had,on evidence led before it,alluded among others to the respondent's right to excavate and sell gravel and stones and enjoyment thereof by the respondent",1
9,In these circumstances it would be fair and proper that the respondent is not subjected to a further inquiry under.s.37(2) of the Code so far as his right to excavating gravel and stones from the two villages of Kapoda and Isarwada is concerned,1
9,"If and when he prefers a claim to this particular mineral productfrom other villages comprised in his grant or to the other mines ormineral products in all the villages including Isarwada and Kapodaan inquiry into such claim under s.37(2) could be held,but even the decision at such inquiry would be subject to adjudication by a Civil Court in appropriate proceedings,for the final pronouncement on such rights must,as is clear from the scheme ,of the Bombay Land Revenue Code,always rest with the Civil Court",1
9,"In this view of the matter,we feel that the High Court was right in its final conclusion whereby it has quashed the inquiry initiated by the Collecor under s.37(2) of the Code and issued the necessary injunction prayed for by the respondent",1
9,"The appeal is,therefore,dismissed with costs",4
9,Appeal dismissed,4
23,The accused-appellant has been held guily of of-fences punishable under Section 302 and Section 376(2)(f) of Indian Penal Code,6
23,The trial Court sentenced the appellant to death under Section 302 IPC and to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and pay a fine of Rs,3
23,"10,000, in default of payment to undergo further R.I. for 3 years, under Section 376(2)(f) IPC",3
23,While the learned Additional Sessions Judge made a reference to the High Court for confirmation of death sentence under Section 366 Cr,6
23,"P.C., the appellant preferred an appeal putting in issue his conviction and sentence",6
23,The criminal reference and the criminal appeal were heard by a division bench of Rajasthan High Court,6
23,"The two learned Judges, constituting the division bench, differed in their opinion",6
23,"In the opinion of one learned Judge, the circumstantial evidence, on which rests the prosecution case, was not sufficient to record a finding of guilty against the appellant on any of the charges framed against him",6
23,"In the opinion of the other learned Judge, the prosecution evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction, as recorded by the trial Court, though, the case was not one of those 'rarest of rare cases' as would warrant death sentence being awarded to the appellant",6
23,"In view of the difference of opinion, the learned acting Chief Justice assigned the case for hearing by a third Judge under Section 392 of Cr",6
23,P.C,6
23,"The third learned Judge has, on an independent appreciation of evidence, recorded his own findings upholding the conviction of the accused on both the charges framed against him and thus agreeing with one of the two learned Judges constituting the division bench in conclusion",6
23,"In the result, the High Court has declined the confirmation of death sentence but upheld the conviction on both the charges found proved and dismissed the appeal laying challenge to the conviction subject to modification in the sentence by substituting sentence of life imprisonment for death sentence under Section 302 IPC",3
23,The accused-appellant has filed this appeal by special leave,3
23,"Kumari S, a young child aged about 5 years, was last seen at about 4 p.m. on 18th March, 1991 and thereafter she did not return home",6
23,"At about 7 a.m. on 19th March 1991, Kishori Lal, PW4 informed BD (PW2), the unfortunate father of S, that dead body of a girl was lying near Mohalla Basera on the outskirts of village Kotputli",6
23,BD rushed to the place only to find that the dead body was of none else than his own daughter S. Blood was oozing out from her mouth and private parts,6
23,A noose was also found around her neck,6
23,At 7.25 a.m. on 19.3.1991 first information report was lodged by BD at police station Kotputli,6
23,Offence was registered under Sections 302 and 376 IPC,6
23,The inves-tigation commenced,6
23,"The dead body was sent for post-mortem examination which was performed at 9.30 a.m., on the same day, by a medical board of three doctors",6
23,It was found that the victim was brutally ravished and thereafter killed,6
23,According to the medical opinion the probable cause of death of S was shock produced due to vaginal trauma and rupture of post- fornix along with asphyxia due to ligature around the neck,6
23,All injuries found on the person of the victim could be around 6 of 24 hours old prior to the time of post-mortem examina-tion,6
23,"The vaginal injuries, clotted blood and injuries to post-fornix were indica-tive of rape having been committed on the victim",6
23,The clothes were removed from the dead body and seized,6
23,Slides of vaginal swab were prepared for cyto-chemical analysis for blood and seminal stains,6
23,The forensic science laboratory confirmed presence of Group-B blood on the clothes of deceased,6
23,The accused was arrested on 3.4.1991 on suspicion,6
23,"On 4.4.1991, he was medically examined",6
23,There was no injury on his private parts or on any other part of body,6
23,The clothes on his person did not have any blood or seminal stains,6
23,He was a grown up male of 21 years and capable of performing sexual intercourse,6
23,"On 5.4.1991, at about 12.30 p.m., he gave an information Exbt",6
23,P/23,6
23,and in confirmation of the information led the police to a dry well wherefrom an underwear and baniyan wrapped in a newspaper dated 18.3.1991 were recovered,6
23,The clothes so recovered were sent to forensic science laboratory,6
23,According to report Exbt,6
23,P/27,6
23,human semen was detected on underwear,6
23,P/30 of forensic science laboratory human blood of group 'B' was detected on the underwear,6
23,The accused was challaned and charge-sheeted for the offences as already stated hereinabove,6
23,The prosecution examined 21 witnesses in all,6
23,It is not necessary here to extensively deal with the evidence adduced by the prosecution,6
23,Suffice it to observe that there is no direct evidence connecting the accused with the offences charged,6
23,The prosecution case depends on circumstantial evidence,6
23,The pieces of circumstantial evidence which have been found proved and held as forging an incriminating chain against the accused are as under :- (i) last seen together; (ii) abnormal conduct of the accused; (iii) recovery of underwear and baniyan (which was found to be stained with semen and blood group 'B' which is also the blood-group of the deceased); (iv) False plea of alibi; and (v) Accused absconding since the date of offence,6
23,We would proceed to examine each of the pieces of incriminating circumstantial evidence so as to find out if each one of the circumstantial evidence is proved individually and whether collectively it forges such a chain of incriminating circumstances as would fasten the guilt on the accused beyond by shadow of reasonable doubt,1
23,"In Dhananjoy Chatterjee v. State of West Bengal, [1994] 2 SCC 220 1994 Indlaw SC 1743, (wherein one of us, Dr. A.S. Anand, J., as His Lordship then was, spoke for the Bench",5
23,"this Court held as under : ""In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn have not only to be fully established but also that all the circumstances so established should be of a conclusive nature and consistent only with the hypoth-esis of the guilt of the accused",5
23,Those circumstances should not be capable of being explained by any other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused and the chain of the evidence must be so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the belief consistent with the innocence of the accused,5
23,"It needs no reminder that legally estab-lished circumstances and not merely indignation of the court can form the basis of conviction and the more serious the crime, the greater should be the care taken to scrutinize the evidence lest suspicion takes the place of proof",5
23,"In Dhananjoy Chatterjee's case 1994 Indlaw SC 1743 (supra), the decision of this Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra, [1984] 4 SCC 116 1984 Indlaw SC 432, was relied on",5
23,"In the later case, it was also held that a false explanation or false plea taken by the accused can be used as an additional link in the chain of circumstantial evidence subject to satisfication of three essential conditions, namely (i) various links in the chain of evidence led by the prosecution have been satisfactorily proved, (ii) the said circumstance points to the guilt of the accused with reasonable definiteness, and (iii) the circumstance is in proxim-ity to the time and situation",5
23,i,5
23,"Last seen together : On the point of last seen together there is solitary testimony of a child witness Shalu, PW7, aged about 4 years on 23.3.1992, the date of her examination in the court",5
23,On asking a few questions by way of preliminary examination the learned Trial Judge found that the witness could 'answer some of the questions,5
23,"She stated that, accompanied by Phukla-another young girl, a cousin of hers, and S the deceased, she had gone to purchase balloon from the shop of Goma",5
23,"While returning the accused told S that her feet were mudstained and he would wash her feet and saying so he took S inside his house, leaving behind the two girls, including Shalu PW7, who returned to their houses leaving S behind",5
23,It is this testimony which has been relied upon by the Trial Court as also by the High Court as the evidence of 'last seen together,1
23,The witness is a child witness of very tender age and examined in the Court almost a year after the date of the incident,1
23,We have very carefully read the statement of this witness,1
23,There is nothing in her statement to suggest that what she is narrating in the court is the story of a day soon before the date and time of the incident or the date on which dead body of S was found,1
23,"To constitute evidence of last seen together, the evidence must definitely permit an inference being drawn that the victim and the accused were seen together at a point of time in close proximity with the time and date of the commission of crime",1
23,"From the evi-dence of Shalu, PW7 such an inference cannot be drawn",1
23,"Goma, to whose shop the three girls had gone to buy balloon, has not been examined",1
23,There is something mysterious about the discovery of Shalu as a witness to the incident,1
23,S has died,1
23,The third girl who was with S and Shalu has not been examined either in the Court or during investigation,1
23,"The statement of Shahu was recorded during investigation on 25.3.1991, i.e. about six days after the date of incident",1
23,"Harish Chand Sharma, the Investigating Officer, was specifically asked how the name of this witness came to his knowledge during investigation",1
23,He gave an evasive answer saying that the fact that Shalu was accompanying S 'must have come in the staement of the witnesses,1
23,He was further asked to name the witness in whose statement Shalu's reference was available but the investigation officer drew a blank and could not tell the name of the witness from whom any clue as to Shalu was received by him,1
23,"Thus how and in what manner the investigating officer came to learn about Shalu, PW7 so as to record her statement during investigation remains shrounded in mystery",1
23,"The fact remains that the testimony of Shalu, PW 7 aged 4 years, even if taken at its face value, does not constitute such a circumstance as to draw an incriminating inference against the accused and connect him with the crime",1
23,ii,1
23,"Abnormal conduct of accused Kalu Ram, PW5 stated that two or three days after the date of dead body of S having been found",1
23,he and Santosh,1
23,PW9 had gone to see a movie in a cinema hall where the accused was employed as a gate-keeper,1
23,There the accused had enquired from them as to what was the punishment awardable to an offender who was found to have been committed rape on a girl and killed her,1
23,The accused was told by the witness that the punishment could be 20 or even 40 years of imprisonment or imprisonment for life,1
23,Thereafter the wit- nesses went to see movie in the cinema hall,1
23,"During cross-examination, Kalu Ram stated that the accused was his neighbour, previously known to him",1
23,"On a pertinent question the witness stated that while making such a query there was no change in the facial expression of the accused, that is, he had remained normal",1
23,"Santosh, PW9, did not support the version of Kalu Ram and was declared hostile",1
23,"Without going into the question as to whether the statement of Kalu Ram, PW5 is to be believed or not in view of the same having not been supported by Santosh PW9, let us assess the intrinsic value of such testimony as a piece of incriminating evidence",1
23,It appears that to begin with the death of S was a blind murder and the police was clue-less about the likely offender,1
23,The police appears to have embarked upon a search akin to a combing operation and in that process several suspected characters were called and interrogated,1
23,"Harish Chand Sharma, PW21 stated that between 19th and 25th March, 1991 the accused Subhash was called at the police station several times for making enquiries",1
23,He did not remember and was therefore not in a position to tell how many number of times the accused Subhash was called for interrogation or making enquiries,1
23,On seeing the case diary he stated that on 21.3.1991 the accused was definitely called twice on the same day though there is no mention of what enquiries were made from him,1
23,"However, the accused was not detained and was sent back",1
23,"Any person even if innocent and not connected in any way with a gruesome crime which had recently occurred and was talk of the town, if called by police and interrogated as a suspect, would be scared and be apprehensive of the likelihood of his being implicated in the crime",1
23,"Placed in such situation if a villager, unaware of the law, happens to ask a person, who he feels knows the things better than what he himself does, as to what would be the period of incarceration to be suffered by any person for such an offence the impulse for inquiry may be outcome of a feeling of nervousness or mere inquisitiveness; such an enquiry is not necessarily suggestive of the working of a criminal mind",1
23,"iii) Recovery of underwear stained with blood and semen Strangely enough the underwear and baniyan though discovered and seized, on an information given by the accused and on his pointing out apparently on a statement recorded under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, have not been produced and exhibited in the court",1
23,What happened to these clothes is not known,1
23,There is not investigation directed towards finding out and no evidence worth its name collected and adduced in the court to show that the underwear and baniyan were of the accused,1
23,"Insofar as baniyan is concerned, it has no stains of any type on it and therefore its discovery and seizure is meaningless and irrelevant",1
23,"So far as the underwear is concerned, the investigation suffers from another infirmity also",1
23,Blood sam-ple of the accused was not collected and therefore not grouped,1
23,No evidence is available to show as to what was the blood group of the accused and therefore the possibility of blood on the underwear being of the accused himself cannot be and is not ruled out,1
23,The number and extent of spread of stains is also not known,1
23,"Shri Sushil Kumar Jain, the learned counsel for the accused-appellant has placed reliance on Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit v. State of Maharashtra, AIR (1981",2
23,SC 765 1980 Indlaw SC 47,2
23,Therein a charge under Sections 376 and 302  IPC  was sought to be substantiated on circumstanctial evidence,2
23,One of the circumstan-tial evidence relied on was that a human blood stain of 'B' group was found on the accused's pant which blood group was also of the deceased,2
23,Another circumstantial evidence relied on was that a stain of semen was found on the under-pant of the accused,2
23,This Court held that the presence of blood-stain of 'B' group measuring 0.5 cm,2
23,"in diameter on the appellant's pant and of a dried stain of semen on his under-pant, were circumstances for too feeble to establish that the appellant raped or murdered the victim",2
23,B' group is not uncommon group of blood and no effort was made to exclude the possibility that the blood of the accused belonged to the same group,2
23,"As regards the dried stain of semen on the appellant's under-pant, the court observed that the accused was a grown-up man of 30 years and no compelling inference could arise that the stain was caused during the course of the sexual assault committed by him on the victim girl",2
23,In the present case the age of the accused was about 21 years at the time of the incident,2
23,On his arrest he was subjected to medical examination and found to be a potent and capable person,2
23,"Presence of semen stain on underwear, assuming that the underwear belonged to the accused though there is no evidence adduced in this regard, is not by itself an incriminating piece of evidence connecting the accused with the crime in question",2
23,"So also the discov-ery of 'B' group blood-stain on the underwear cannot be treated as an incrimi-nating piece of evidence against the accused connecting him with the crime because there is no evidence that the underwear belonged to the accused and further the possiblity of the underwear being stained with the blood of the person to whom it belonged, or the accused if he was wearing it has not been ruled out",2
23,False plea of alibi,1
23,The High Court has gone completely amiss in holding that a plea of alibi was taken by the accused and that was found to be false,1
23,The accused has not stated during his statement under Section 313 Cr,1
23,P.C. and nowhere suggested during cross-examination of prosecution witnesses that at the time of the incident he was at a place wherefrom he could not have reached the place of the offence on the date and at the time of its commission,1
23,"Although the dead body of the victim was found on the outskirts of the village, however, there is no material available on record to fix the place and the likely time at which rape was committed on S and then she was murdered",1
23,What is being treated as the plea of alibi by the trial court and the High Court is this,1
23,The accused appears to have been engaged as a causal (not regular) gate-keeper at 'Hira Moti'-a local talkies,1
23,The proprietor of the cinema hall was examined to state that on 18th and 19th March the accused had taken leave from his job and during those days he was not present on duty,1
23,This piece of evidence was put to the accused during his statement under Section 313 Cr,1
23,P.C. and in reply he stated 'Galat Hai' (not correct,1
23,The purpose of asking questions during examination under Section 313 Cr,1
23,P.C. is to afford the accused personally an opportunity of explaining any incriminating circumstance so appearing in evidence against him,1
23,The accused may or may not avail the opportunity for offering his explanation,1
23,The accused did not avail the opportunity and stood short by simply stating that the statement of cinema owner was not correct,1
23,Literal meaning of alibi is 'elsewhere,1
23,"In law this term is used to express that defence in a criminal prosecution, where the party accused, in order to prove that he could not have committed the crime charged against him, offers evidence that he was in a different place at that time",1
23,"The plea taken should be capable of meaning that having regard to the time and place when and where he is alleged to have committed the offence, he could not have been present",1
23,The plea of alibi postulates the physical impossibility of the presence of the accused at the scene of offence by reason of his presence at another place,1
23,"See Law Lexicon, P. Ramnath Iyer, Second Edition, P.87",1
23,"Denial by an accused of an assertion made by his employer that the accused was on leave of absence from duty on the date of offence does not, by any stretch of reasoning or logic, amount to pleading alibi",1
23,"We are clearly of the opinion that the accused-appellant has not taken a plea of alibi and therefore the question of finding it false, and then drawing an inference adverse to him, does not arise at all",1
23,v) Absconding of the accused Was the accused absconding at all,1
23,Grave injustice has been done to the accused by holding it as a fact that the accused was absconding after the date of the incident and then treating the so-called absconding as a piece of incrimi-nating circumstantial evidence against the accused,1
23,"According to Harish Chand Sharma, the accused was arrested on 3.4.1991 (vide Exbt",1
23,"P/21) at Behror, which is a place situated at a distance of about 30-35 kms",1
23,from village Kotputli where the incident had taken place,1
23,Though the accused is alleged to have been arrested at Behror but the memo of arrest was not prepared at Behror; it was prepared at village Kotputli,1
23,The memo of arrest does not state the arrest of accused having been made at Behror,1
23,If the accused was arrested at Behror there is no reason why the memo of arrest should not have been prepared at village Behror,1
23,At least this fact should have been mentioned in the memo of arrest even if the same was prepared at village Kotputli,1
23,"Secondly, Harish Chand Sharma himself states that between 19.3.1991 and 25.3.1991 the ac-cused was called several times at the police station and on 21.3.1991 itself he was called twice in a day",1
23,"Thus, he was always available to the police",1
23,"Kalu Ram, PW5, accompanied by a friend Santosh, PW9, had gone to see a movie in cinema talkies Heera-Moti two days after the date of the incident and there the accused was present on his duty",1
23,"There is no evidence adduced by the prosecution to hold that soon after the date of the offence the accused was found missing from his residence or the place of his employment and was not available, though searched, at the place or places where normally he ought to have been",1
23,"Hence, it could not have been held that the accused was absconding",1
23,Conclusion,1
23,"Thus, none of the pieces of evidence relied on as incriminating, by the trial court and the High Court, can be treated as incriminating pieces of circumstantial evidence against the accused",1
23,Though the offence is gruesome and revolts the human conscience but an accused can be convicted only on legal evidence and if only a chain of circumstantial evidence has been so forged as to rule out the possibility of any other reasonable hypothesis excepting the guilt of the accused,1
23,"In Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit's case 1980 Indlaw SC 47 (supra), this Court cautioned - ""human nature is too willing, when faced with brutal crimes, to spin stories out of strong suspicions",1
23,"This Court has held time and again that between may be true and must be true there is a long distance to travel which must be covered by clear, cogent and unimpeachable evidence by the prosecu-tion before an accused is condemned a convict",1
23,"The Trial Court and the High Court have proceeded on an assumption of availability of five pieces forging links in the chain of circumstantial evi-dence out of which we have found, as stated hereinabove, four of the alleged circumstances not to be pieces of incriminating circumstantial evidence at all",1
23,We are left with circumstance no,1
23,"3 only, i.e., recovery of underwear and baniyan stained with semen and human blood group 'B', which alone, in the fact and circumstances of the case discussed hereinabove cannot form basis of conviction of the accused-appellant for the offence charged",1
23,"Before parting with the case we would like to place on record, an observation of ours, touching an aspect of the case",1
23,There are clueless crimes committed,1
23,The factum of a cognizable crime having been committed is known but neither the identity of the accused is disclosed nor is there any indication available of the witnesses who would be able to furnish useful and relevant evidence,1
23,Such offences put to test the wits of an investigating officer,1
23,"A vigilant investigating officer, well-versed with the techniques of the job, is in a position to collect the threads of evidence finding out the path which leads to the culprit",1
23,"The ends, which the administration of cirminal justice serves, are not achieved merely by catching hold of the culprit",1
23,The accusation has to be proved to hilt in a court of law,1
23,The evidence of investigating officer given in the court should have a rhythm explaining step by step how the investigation proceeded leading to detection of the offender and collection of evidence against him,1
23,This is necessary to exclude the likelihood of any innocent having been picked up and branded as culprit and then the gravity of the offence arousing human sympathy persuading the mind to be carried away by doubtful or dubious circumstances treating them as of 'beyond doubt' evidentiary value,1
23,The appeals are allowed,4
23,Conviction of the accused-appellant under Sections 302 and 376(2)(f) of Indian Penal Code is set aside,4
23,He is acquitted of the charges framed against him,4
23,He shall be set at liberty forthwith if not required to be detained in connection with any other offence,4
23,Appeals allowed,4
28,Appellant before us was detained u/s.3 of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities,6
28,"Act,1974",6
28,"for short ""COFEPOSA",6
28,"He is the Managing Director of a company,registered and incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act,known as M/s",6
28,Sundesh Springs Private Limited,6
28,It was an exporter and held a valid licence therefor,6
28,The company was to export products of alloy steel,6
28,"Upon exporting of alloy steel,it was entitled to credits under the Duty Entitlement Pass Book (DEPB",6
28,Scheme introduced by the Government of India with an object of encouraging exports,6
28,He allegedly misdeclared both the value and description of goods upon procuring fake and false bills through one Prabhjot Singh,6
28,"The said Prabhjot Singh was said to have been operating three firms,viz",6
28,M/s,6
28,"S.P.Industrial Corporation,M/s",6
28,Aaysons (India) and M/s,6
28,"P.J.Sales Corporation,Ludhiana",6
28,"It was allegedly found that non-alloy steel,bars,rods,etc.of value ranging from Rs.15/-to Rs.17/-per kg.were exported in the guise of alloy steel forgings,bars,rods,etc.by declaring their value thereof from Rs.110/-to Rs.150/-per kg.and the export proceeds over and above the actual price were being routed through Hawala Channel",6
28,The officers of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) searched the factory as well as the residential premises of Appellant and that of Prabhjot Singh,6
28,Various incriminating documents were recovered,6
28,Appellant and the said Prabhjot Singh made statements u/s.108 of the Customs Act,6
28,Prabhjot Singh allegedly admitted to have supplied fake bills to units owned and controlled by Appellant on commission basis without actual supply of the goods,6
28,"It was also found that Appellant had declared goods exported as ""alloy steel"" whereas after the tests conducted by Central Revenue Control Laboratory,they were found to be ""other than alloy steel"",i.e.,non-alloy",6
28,"The Consul (Economic),Consulate General of India at Dubai allegedly confirmed the existence of a parallel set of export invoices",6
28,Invoices with a higher value were presented before the Indian Customs Authorities with a view to avail DEPB incentives but in fact invoices with a lower value were presented for clearance,6
28,"On the aforementioned allegations,an order of detention was issued on 5.4.2005.Appellant moved for issuance of a writ of Habeas Corpus before the High Court of Judicature of Punjab and Haryana",6
28,The said writ petition was dismissed by an order dated 23.11.2005 by a learned Single Judge,6
28,"A letters patent appeal,concededly which was not maintainable,was filed thereagainst which was dismissed by reason of the impugned judgment",6
28,"Although before the High Court,the principal ground urged on behalf of Appellant in questioning the legality or validity of the order of detention was unexplained delay in passing the order of detention which did not find favour with the High Court",2
28,"Before us,several other grounds,viz.,non placement of vital/ material documents before the detaining authority,non-supply of documents relied on or referred to in the order of detention as also non-application of mind on the part of the detaining authority had been raised",1
28,"In the meantime admittedly the period of detention being over,Appellant had been set at large",1
28,He was released from custody on 17.5.2006,1
28,"This appeal,however,has been pressed as a proceeding under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act,1976 (for short ""SAFEMA""),has been initiated against Appellant",0
28,We may first deal with the question of unexplained delay,1
28,In this regard we may notice the following dates,1
28,"On 13.10.2003,Appellant was arrested",6
28,He was discharged on bail on 6.1.2004.Several inquiries were conducted both inside and outside India,6
28,A report in relation to overseas inquiry was received on 12.5.2004.On 25.6.2004 proposal of detention was sent which was approved on 2.12.2004.On,6
28,"20.12.2004,the authorities of the DRI stated that transactions after 11.10.2003 were not under scrutiny",6
28,"Furthermore,the authorities of the DRI by a letter dated 28.02.2005 requested the Bank to defreeze the bank accounts of Appellants",6
28,The order of detention was passed on 5.4.2005,6
28,"The learned Additional Solicitor General,who appeared on behalf of Respondent has drawn our attention to a long list of dates showing that searches were conducted and statements of a large number of persons had to be recorded",2
28,"The final order of detention was preceded not only on the basis of raids conducted in various premises,recording of statements of a large number of witnesses,carrying on intensive inquiries both within India and outside India,obtaining test reports from three different laboratories but also the fact that despite notices Appellant and his associates did not cooperate with the investigating authorities",2
28,"They initiated various civil proceedings from time to time,obtained various interim orders and,thus,delay in passing the order of detention cannot be said to have not been explained",2
28,"Learned counsel would contend that keeping in view the nature and magnitude of an offence under COFEPOSA,a distinction must be made between an order of detention passed under COFEPOSA vis-a-vis other Acts as per the law laid down by this Court in Rajendrakumar Natvarlal Shah v",2
28,State of Gujarat and Others [(1988) 3 SCC 153 1988 Indlaw SC 71] and in that view of the matter the High Court must be held to have arrived at a correct decision,2
28,"Indisputably,delay to some extent stands explained",1
28,"But,we fail to understand as to why despite the fact that the proposal for detention was made on 2.12.2004,the order of detention was passed after four months",1
28,"We must also notice that in the meantime on 20.12.2004,the authorities of the DRI had clearly stated that transactions after 11.10.2003 were not under the scrutiny stating: ""In our letter mentioned above,your office was requested not to issue the DEPB scripts to M/s",1
28,Girnar Impex Limited and M/s,1
28,"Siri Amar Exports,only in respect of the pending application,if any,filed by these parties up to the date of action i.e.11.10.2003 as the past exports were under scrutiny being doubtful as per the intelligence received in this office",1
28,"This office never intended to stop the export incentives occurring to the parties,after the date of action i.e.11.10.2003.In the civil,your office letter",1
28,No.B.L.-2/Misc,1
28,"Am-2003/Ldh dated 17.05.2004 is being referred,which is not received in this office",1
28,"You are,therefore,requested to supply photocopy of the said letter to the bearer of this letter as this letter is required for filing reply to the Hon'ble Court",1
28,"Furthermore,as noticed hereinbefore,the authorities of the DRI by a letter dated 28.02.2005 requested the Bank to defreeze the bank accounts of Appellant",1
28,"The said documents,in our opinion,were material",1
28,"It was,therefore,difficult to appreciate why order of detention could not be passed on the basis of the materials gathered by them",1
28,"It is no doubt true that if the delay is sufficiently explained,the same would not be a ground for quashing an order of detention under COFEPOSA,but as in this case a major part of delay remains unexplained",1
28,"We may also place on record that Sen.,J.in Rajendrakumar Natvarlal Shah 1988 Indlaw SC 71 (supra),while laying down various stages of the procedures leading to an order of detention,opined that rule as to unexplained delay in taking action is not inflexible and a detention under COFEPOSA may be considered from a different angle",5
28,The question came up for consideration recently in Rajinder Arora v,5
28,"Union of India and Others [(2006) 4 SCC 796 2006 Indlaw SC 87] wherein it has been held: ""Furthermore no explanation whatsoever has been offered by the Respondent as to why the order of detention has been issued after such a long time",5
28,The said question has also not been examined by the authorities before issuing the order of detention,5
28,The question as regard delay in issuing the order of detention has been held to be a valid ground for quashing an order of detention by this Court in T.D.Abdul Rahman v,5
28,"State of Kerala and others [AIR 1990 SC 225 1989 Indlaw SC 205] stating: ""The conspectus of the above decisions can be summarised thus: The question whether the prejudicial activities of a person necessitating to pass an order of detention is proximate to the time when the order is made or the live-link between the prejudicial activities and the purpose of detention is snapped depends on the facts and circumstances of each case",5
28,No hard and fast rule can be precisely formulated that would be applicable under all circumstances and no exhaustive guidelines can be laid down in that behalf,5
28,It follows that the test of proximity is not a rigid or mechanical test by merely counting number of months between the offending acts and the order of detention,5
28,"However,when there is undue and long delay between the prejudicial activities and the passing of detention order,the court has to scrutinise whether the detaining authority has satisfactorily examined such a delay and afforded a tenable and reasonable explanation as to why such a delay has occasioned,when called upon to answer and further the court has to investigate whether the causal connection has been broken in the circumstances of each case",5
28,"Similarly when there is unsatisfactory and unexplained delay between the date of order of detention and the date of securing the arrest of the detenu,such a delay would throw considerable doubt on the genuineness of the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority leading to a legitimate inference that the detaining authority was not really and genuinely satisfied as regards the necessity for detaining the detenu with a view to preventing him from acting in a prejudicial manner",5
28,The delay caused in this case in issuing the order of detention has not been explained,5
28,"In fact,no reason in that behalf whatsoever has been assigned at all",5
28,"Delay,as is well known,at both stages has to be explained",1
28,The court is required to consider the question having regard to the overall picture,1
28,We may notice that in Sk,5
28,Serajul v,5
28,"State of West Bengal [(1975) 2 SCC 78 1974 Indlaw SC 475],this Court opined: ""There was thus delay at both stages and this delay,unless satisfactorily explained,would throw considerable doubt on the genuineness of the subjective satisfaction of the District Magistrate,Burdwan recited in the order of detention",5
28,"It would be reasonable to assume that if the District Magistrate of Burdwan was really and genuinely satisfied after proper application of mind to the materials before him that it was necessary to detain the petitioner with a view to preventing him from acting in a prejudicial manner,he would have acted with greater promptitude both in making the order of detention as also in securing the arrest of the petitioner,and the petitioner would not have been allowed to remain at large for such a long period of time to carry on his nefarious activities",5
28,"In Abdul Salam Alias Thiyyan S/o Thiyyan Mohammad,Detenu No.962,General Prison,Trivandrum v",5
28,"Union of India and Others [(1990) 3 SCC 15 1990 Indlaw SC 994] whereupon the learned Additional Solicitor General has placed strong reliance,this Court found that there had been potentiality or likelihood of prejudicial activities and,thus,or mere delay,as long as,it is explained,the court may not strike down the detention",5
28,"In the instant case,we have noticed hereinbefore that the authorities of DRI themselves categorically stated that the activities of Appellant after 11.10.2003 were not in question and in fact all the bank accounts were defreezed",1
28,"Although learned Additional Solicitor General may be correct in his submissions that ordinarily we should not exercise our discretionary jurisdiction u/art.136 of the Constitution of India by allowing Appellant to raise new grounds but,in our opinion,we may have to do so as an order of detention may have to be considered from a different angle",1
28,It may be true that the period of detention is over,1
28,It may further be true that Appellant had remained in detention for the entire period but it is one thing to say that the writ of Habeas Corpus in this circumstances cannot issue but it is another thing to say that an order of detention is required to be quashed so as to enable the detainee to avoid his civil liabilities under SAFEMA as also protect his own reputation,1
28,"In a case of this nature,we do not think,in view of the admitted facts,that we would not permit Appellant to raise the said questions",1
28,"So far as the question of non-placement of material documents before the detaining authority is concerned,we may notice the following dates: (i",6
28,"By a letter dated 5.7.2002,the authorities of DRI stated that Appellant stood exonerated for earlier years after detailed examination",6
28,ii,6
28,"By a letter dated 20.12.2004,the authorities of DRI stated that transactions after 11.10.2003 were not under scrutiny and by letters dated 28.2.2005 and 7.3.2005,the bank accounts of Appellant were defreezed",6
28,iii,6
28,"By reason of the Civil Court by orders dated 7.5.2004 and 31.5.2004,the bank accounts of M/s",6
28,Girnar and Shri Amar were defreezed,6
28,iv,6
28,"By an order dated 13.8.2004,the Tribunal ordered release of goods",6
28,"v) By orders dated 31.8.2004 and 28.10.2004,the Civil Judge directed release of documents to Appellant",6
28,vi,6
28,"By an order dated 18.11.2004,the Civil Court issued contempt notice to the authorities of DRI for non-release of documents and the authorities of DRI made a statement before the court that the documents are being returned",6
28,We have noticed hereinbefore that learned Additional Solicitor General contended that Appellant obstructed the proceedings by initiating various civil litigations,1
28,"But,indisputably,those documents involving the civil court proceedings were not placed before the detaining authority",1
28,"If the same had not been done,not only the delay,in issuing the order of detention stood unexplained but also thereby the order itself would become vitiated",1
28,"Furthermore,the civil court proceedings were over on 19.11.2004",1
28,"Evidently,the detaining authority did not take immediate steps to detain Appellant",1
28,Why the documents pertaining to the proceedings of the Civil Court had not been placed before the detaining authority has not been explained,1
28,"On their own showing,Respondents admit that they were relevant documents",1
28,"The question has been considered by this Court in Rajinder Arora 2006 Indlaw SC 87 (supra) stating: ""Admittedly,furthermore,the status report called for from the Customs Department has not been taken into consideration by the competent authorities",5
28,A Division Bench of this Court in K.S.Nagamuthu v,5
28,State of Tamil Nadu & Ors.[2005 (9) SCALE 534 2005 Indlaw SC 748] struck down an order of detention on the ground that the relevant material had been withheld from the detaining authority; which in that case was a letter of the detenu retracting from confession made by him,5
28,In P.Saravanan v,5
28,"State of T.N.and Others [(2001) 10 SCC 212],it was stated: ""When we went through the grounds of detention enumerated by the detaining authority we noticed that there is no escape from the conclusion that the subjective satisfaction arrived at by the detaining authority was the cumulative result of all the grounds mentioned therein",5
28,"It is difficult for us to say that the detaining authority would have come to the subjective satisfaction solely on the strength of the confession attributed to the petitioner dated 7-11-1999,particularly because it was retracted by him",5
28,It is possible to presume that the confession made by the co-accused Sowkath Ali would also have contributed to the final opinion that the confession made by the petitioner on 7-11-1999 can safely be relied on,5
28,"What would have been the position if the detaining authority was apprised of the fact that Sowkath Ali had retracted his confession,is not for us to make a retrospective judgment at this distance of time",5
28,In Ahamed Nassar v,5
28,"State of Tamil Nadu and Others [(1999) 8 SCC 473 1999 Indlaw SC 778],this Court opined: ""The question is not whether the second part of the contents of those letters was relevant or not but whether they were placed before the detaining authority for his consideration",5
28,There could be no two opinions on it,5
28,It contains the very stand of the detenu of whatever worth,5
28,What else would be relevant if not this,5
28,It may be that the detaining authority might have come to the same conclusion as the sponsoring authority but its contents are relevant which could not be withheld by the sponsoring authority,5
28,The letter dated 19-4-1999 reached the sponsoring authority and reached well within time for it being placed before the detaining authority,5
28,"There is an obligation cast on the sponsoring authority to place it before the detaining authority,which has not been done",5
28,Even the letter dated 23-4-1999 which reached the Secretary concerned at 3.00 p.m.on 26-4-1999 was much before the formal detention order dated 28-4-1999.The Secretary concerned was obliged to place the same before the detaining authority,5
28,The respondent authority was not right in not placing it as it contains not only what is already referred to in the bail application dated 1-4-1999 but something more,5
28,The statements of Appellant and Prabhjot Singh were noticed by the detaining authority,5
28,It had specifically been referred to in extenso in the order of detention,5
28,"It is,however,stated that the records were tampered with at the instance of Appellant",5
28,The self-inculpatory statements of Appellant and that of Prabhjot Singh were said to have been taken off the file,5
28,Respondents contended that on first information report was registered against Appellant as also one sepoy Narender Singh,5
28,But the said information report was registered only on 6.4.2005 and not prior to the date of order of detention,5
28,"In paragraph 36 of the order of detention,the detaining authority stated: ""In view of the facts mentioned above,I have no hesitation in arriving at the conclusion that you have through your acts of omission and commission indulged in prejudicial activities as narrated above",6
28,"Considering the nature and gravity of the offence,the well planned manner in which you have engaged yourself in such prejudicial activities and your role therein as brought out above,all of which reflect your high potentiality and propensity to indulge in such prejudicial activities in future,I am satisfied that there is a need to prevent you from indulging in such prejudicial activities in future by detention under COFEPOSA ACT,1974 with a view to preventing you from smuggling goods in future",6
28,We have been taken through the order of detention,1
28,The statements of Appellant and the said Prabhjot Singh were recorded therein in extenso,1
28,Recording of such statement must have been made from the xeroxed copies of such documents which were available with the detaining authority,1
28,The self-inculpatory statements of Appellant as also Prabhjot Singh purported to have been made in terms of S.108 of the Customs Act were required to be considered before the order of detention could be passed,1
28,The same was not done,1
28,The original of such documents might not been available with the detaining authority but admittedly the xeroxed copies were,1
28,It has not been denied or disputed that even the xeroxed copies of the said documents had not been supplied to the detenue,1
28,It may be true that Appellant in his representation dated 14.06.2005 requested for showing him the original documents referred to or mentioned in the grounds of detention but then at least the xeroxed copies thereof should have been made available to him,1
28,"Learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that due to non-supply of documents which were not vital or have merely been referred to as incidental,the order of detention may not become vitiated as was been held by this Court in Kamarunnissa v",5
28,Union of India and Another,1
28,1991) 1 SCC 128 1990 Indlaw SC 85].The said decision was rendered in a different fact situation,5
28,"In the said decision,this Court stated the law,thus: "" If,merely an incidental reference is made to some part of the investigation concerning a co-accused in the grounds of detention which has no relevance to the case set up against the detenus it is difficult to understand how the detenus could contend that they were denied the right to make an effective representation",5
28,It is not sufficient to say that the detenus were not supplied the copies of the documents in time on demand but it must further be shown that the non-supply has impaired the detenu's right to make an effective and purposeful representation,5
28,"Demand of any or every document,however irrelevant it may be for the concerned detenu,merely on the ground that there is a reference thereto in the grounds of detention,cannot vitiate an otherwise legal detention order",5
28,"No hard and fast rule can be laid down in this behalf but what is essential is that the detenu must show that the failure to supply the documents before the meeting of the Advisory Board had impaired or prejudiced his right,however slight or insignificant it may be",5
28,"In the present case,except stating that the documents were not supplied before the meeting of the Advisory Board,there is no pleading that it had resulted in the impairment of his right nor could counsel for the petitioners point out any such prejudice",5
28,"We are,therefore,of the opinion that the view taken by the Bombay High Court in this behalf is unassailable",5
28,"What is,therefore,relevant was as to whether the documents were material",6
28,"If the documents were material so as to enable the detenue to make an effective representation which is his constitutional as also statutory right,non-supply thereof would vitiate the order of detention",6
28,It is a trite law that all documents which are not material are not necessary to be supplied,1
28,"What is necessary to be supplied is the relevant and the material documents,but,thus,all relevant documents must be supplied so as to enable the detenue to make an effective representation which is his fundamental right u/art.22(5) of the Constitution of India",1
28,Right to make an effective representation is also a statutory right.[See Sunila Jain v,1
28,2006) 3 SCC 321 2006 Indlaw SC 65,1
28,"In this case,the statements of Appellant and Prabhjot Singh,in our opinion,were material",1
28,They could not have been withheld,1
28,"If original of the said documents were not available,xeroxed copies thereof could have been made available to him",1
28,The detaining authority moreover while relying on the said documents in one part of the order of detention could not have stated in another part that he was not relying thereupon,1
28,The very fact that he had referred to the said statements in ex tenso is itself a pointer to the fact that he had relied upon the said documents,1
28,"Even in the earlier part of the impugned order of detention,i.e.detaining authority appears to have drawn his own conclusions",1
28,"In view of our findings aforementioned,it is not necessary to consider the contention raised by Mr",4
28,Mukul Rohtagi that order of detention suffers from non-application of mind,4
28,"The judgment of the High Court,therefore,cannot be sustained",4
28,It is set aside accordingly and the order of detention passed against Appellant is quashed,4
28,The appeal is allowed,4
28,No costs,4
28,Appeal allowed,4
29,"This appeal by Special Leave arises out of a judgment and order dated 1st March,2005",6
29,"rendered by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay,whereby the learned Single Judge has set aside the order passed by the Arbitral Tribunal,holding that they did not have jurisdiction to entertain and try the claim and counter claim made by the parties",6
29,"In order to appreciate the issue,requiring determination,a few relevant facts may be stated",6
29,The appellant M/s,6
29,"Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited is a Government of India Undertaking,under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas and is engaged in refining,distributing and selling of petroleum products all over the country",6
29,The respondent M/s,6
29,"Great Eastern Shipping Company Limited is engaged in the business of shipping and allied activities and owns a fleet of tanker vessels for charter,including the vessel known as JAG PRAJA",6
29,"An agreement,called the Time Charter Party in legal parlance,was entered into between the appellant and the respondent on 6th May,1997 for letting on hire vessels for a period of two years from 22nd September,1996 to 30th June,1997 and from 1st July,1997 to 30th June,1998,on the terms and conditions set out in the said agreement",6
29,"However,before the Charter Party was to come to an end,on 29th June,1998,the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (for short IOC ),acting as agent of the appellant,issued a fax to various ship owners,including the respondent herein,requesting them to extend the validity of the Charter Party Agreement dated 6th May,1997 beyond 30th June,1998 for a period of one month from 1st July,1998 with option for two further extensions of 15 days each",6
29,The respondent agreed to the said proposal,6
29,"Accordingly,on 29th June,1998 an addendum was signed between the parties whereby the validity period of Charter Party was extended for one month with an option for two further extensions for a period of 15 days each",6
29,"The terms and conditions; exceptions and exemptions contained in the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 remained unaltered",6
29,"The parties are ad idem that the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 was extended till 31st August,1998",6
29,"It appears that since Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 was coming to an end on 31st August,1998,the Oil Companies sought permission of the Oil Co-ordination Committee,a wing of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas for further extension of the Charter Party",6
29,"However,the Oil Coordination Committee,by their fax message dated 26th August,1998,declined the request of the Oil Companies,including the appellant,for further extension of Charter Party beyond 31st August,1998.The said fax message was an internal communication between the Oil Coordination Committee and the Oil Companies",6
29,"Thereafter,in September,1998,the IOC for and on behalf of the Oil Industry,floated a fresh tender for carriage of petroleum products along the Indian coast on time charter basis for a period of one year commencing from 1st September,1998 to 31st August,1999,on the terms and conditions set out in the tender document",6
29,"In response to the said tender,the respondent and other vessel owners submitted their bids",6
29,"It seems that being aggrieved of the decision of the IOC to invite revised price bids after opening of the sealed tenders,one of the bidders filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court,questioning the said decision",6
29,The appellant intervened in the said matter,6
29,"The writ petition was disposed of vide order dated 20th August,1999.While disapproving in principle,the action of the IOC in inviting fresh price bids after opening the bids,but without recording final opinion on the merits of the issues raised in writ petition,the Court disposed of the petition,inter alia,directing that (i) the charter hire rates should be fixed by the Tender Evaluation Committee and (ii) as the tender was for the period ending 31st August,1999 and the writ petition was being decided on 20th August,1999,the IOC will not be required to enter into a contract for the period from 1st September,1998",3
29,"to 31st August,1999.It is not in dispute that the vessel JAG PRAJA ,with which we are concerned,continued to be chartered by the appellant till 31st August,1999",3
29,"It appears that pending finalization of a new charter party for the period commencing 1st September,1998,certain meetings took place between the Oil Companies and the Ship Owners,including the respondent herein",6
29,"On 12th October,1998,the respondent informed the IOC that if all its nine vessels,mentioned in the letter,are used at a fair and reasonable rate for one year,from 1st September,1998 to 31st August,1999 for which the tender had been floated,they were agreeable to apply the new agreed rates for use of the said nine vessels from 1st July,1998.On 31st October,1998",6
29,"the IOC faxed to the respondent relevant portion of the message received by them from Oil Co-ordination Committee,extending the period of usage of the existing coastal tanker fleet for the month of October,1998,at 80% charter hire rates,prevailing till 30th June,1998,on provisional basis,subject to adjustment of provisional charter hire with retrospective date from 1st September,1998 against the revised charter hire,to be finalised by the Oil Industry in response to the tender floated by IOC on 1st September,1998.Respondent s consent was asked for",6
29,"The respondent responded immediately vide their letter dated 5th November,1998,agreeing in principle that revised charter hire rates,as and when finalized in response to tender floated by the IOC on 1st September,1998,would be applicable to the vessels which are selected under the tender,retrospectively from 1st September,1998.It was pointed out that the vessels which are not chartered under the tender floated would be at a disadvantage",6
29,"It was clearly stated that since the tender was not finalized,the owners will be guided by the existing terms and conditions",6
29,"Some other objections,not relevant at this stage,were also indicated",6
29,"As such,all said and done,Oil Co-ordination Committee s proposal was not accepted",6
29,"Nevertheless,some suggestions to resolve the controversy were given",6
29,"Thus,the proposal by the Oil Co-ordination Committee was not accepted by the respondent",6
29,"In the alternative,it was suggested by the respondent that the charter period be extended by six months on the existing terms and conditions at a mutually discussed time charter rate",6
29,"Admittedly,the vessels continued to be chartered by the appellant beyond the date of this letter",6
29,"Thereafter,for almost two months,there was no communication between the parties",6
29,"It was only on 31st December,1998 when the IOC issued a fax to the respondent,enclosing draft letter regarding charter party agreement to be signed between the charterers and owners (with minor modification,if necessary),requesting the respondent to sign as per proposal by the 4th January,1999,on which date the respondent expressed its disinclination,stating in reply fax that as per usual practice,pending finalization of new charter,the existing terms and conditions of the charter party continue to apply",6
29,"Finally,it was suggested that: ""We,therefore,suggest that we sign an agreement with you for the period from 1st September,1998 until the matter is finally decided by you under the tender on the existing terms and conditions with the charter hire being provisionally paid on an ad hoc basis at 90% of the rate which was prevailing under the existing Charter Party",6
29,Kindly confirm in order to draw up a suitable agreement accordingly,6
29,Emphasis supplied,6
29,"Vide letter of even date,i.e.4th January,1999,the appellant suggested to the respondent that in the absence of a formal charter party with effect from 1st September,1998,a provisional arrangement for a period of four months effective from 1st September,1998 with an option for extension of one month may be mutually agreed to by payment at the rate of 80% on charter hire prevailing on 30th June,1998,as ad hoc hire",6
29,The respondent was asked to convey their acceptance to the said suggestion,6
29,It appears that the respondent did not respond to the said suggestion by the appellant but all the same its vessel continued to be on charter with the appellant,6
29,"The writ petition was ultimately disposed of on 20th August,1999.It was only after a gap of about seven months that on 15th March,2000,the IOC informed the respondent about the evaluation of the tenders in terms of the order passed by the High Court",6
29,"Charter hire rate worked out by the Committee for vessel JAG PRAJA for the period from 1st September,1998 to 31st August,1999 was communicated to the respondent",6
29,"In response,the respondent,while expressing their disappointment with the rate but purportedly,in view of their long business relations with the appellant conveyed their acceptance of the proposed rate in respect of each of the vessels named in separate letters,all dated 1st",6
29,"May,2000,with the expectation that their outstanding balance of the hire shall be paid to them at the earliest",6
29,"However,the respondent did not convey their acceptance of the charter hire rates for two vessels,viz",6
29,JAG PRAJA and JAG PRAYOG,6
29,"It appears that the respondent wrote various letters to the appellant for upward revision of the rate in respect of these two vessels but seemingly their request was ultimately turned down on 2nd November,2000,on receipt of which,the respondent slammed a legal notice dated 6th November,2000,on the appellant,inter alia,requesting them to revise the rates on the basis of mutual discussions and settle the accounts",6
29,"Having failed to receive any reply to the said notice,by another legal notice dated 1st December,2000,the respondent called upon the appellant to pay balance amount of Rs.43,947,517/-to them as charter hire in respect of vessel JAG PRAJA for the period from 1st September,1998 to 31st August,1999 within 15 days from date of receipt of the said notice or treat it as an arbitration notice",6
29,The name of the arbitrator was also communicated to the appellant,6
29,"It seems that pursuant to the said notice and some subsequent correspondence exchanged between the parties,an Arbitral Tribunal was constituted",6
29,Claims and counter claims were filed before the Arbitral Tribunal,6
29,"On the basis of the pleadings of the parties,the Arbitral Tribunal framed as many as eight issues",6
29,"However,arguments were heard only on the following three issues",6
29,"Issue No.1:-Whether the Hon ble Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent for the period September,1998 to August,1999",1
29,in respect of the vessel Jag Praja for the reasons stated in para 1 of the written statement,1
29,Issue No.2:-Whether there is any common practice that if the vessel is not re-delivered at the end of the period mentioned in the time charter the vessel would be governed by the charter party under which originally it was chartered,1
29,Issue,1
29,No.5:-Whether the time charter party dated 6th,1
29,"May,1997 came to an end by efflux of time on 30th August,1998",1
29,Vide order dated 12th,6
29,"May,2003 the Arbitral Tribunal came to the conclusion that the appellant having invoked the arbitration clause contained in charter party agreement dated 6th May,1997,which was valid upto 31st August,1998",6
29,and as the dispute between the parties related to the period subsequent to 31st,6
29,"August,1998,they had no jurisdiction to decide the Reference",6
29,The learned Tribunal found issue No.2 in the negative and issue No.5 in the affirmative,6
29,"According to the Tribunal on and after 1st September,1998,charter party agreement dated 6th May,1997 was superseded by a fresh agreement and a term of the agreement was that the charter hire rate would be determined by the Oil Co-ordination Committee of the IOC.In nutshell,the Tribunal was of the view that with the performance,original charter party dated 6th May,1997 got extinguished",6
29,The respondent challenged the said Award before the High Court,6
29,"By the impugned order,the learned Single Judge has set aside the said Award,inter alia,holding that Arbitral Tribunal has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the disputes between the parties as the vessel continued to be hired by the appellant for the period subsequent to 31st August,1998 on the same terms and conditions,as were contained in the charter party dated 6th May,1997,only subject to the revision or modification of the rate of hire to be determined by the Oil Co-ordination Committee",6
29,"The learned Judge also felt that the Tribunal had erred in totally excluding from its consideration cls.23 and 4.1 of the charter party dated 6th May,1997,whereunder the charter party was to come to an end on re-delivery of the vessel",6
29,"Admittedly,after 31st August,1998,re-delivery of vessel did not take place and,therefore,in terms of clause 23,the vessel continued to be hired on the same terms and conditions except the term as to the hire charges,on which there was disagreement between the parties",6
29,"It was thus,held that the charter party dated 6th May,1997 did not come to an end by efflux of time and it was extended by the parties on the same terms and conditions except the rate of hire",6
29,Correctness of this order of the High Court is questioned in this appeal,1
29,Mr,2
29,"Sudhir Chandra,learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has assailed the impugned order on the sole ground that the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 having come to an end by efflux of time on 31st August,1998,the arbitration clause contained in it also perished and,therefore,in the absence of a fresh arbitration agreement,claim of the respondent relating to the period 1st September,1998 to 31st August,1999 could not be referred to arbitration by invoking arbitration clause in Charter Party dated 6th May,1997.Laying emphasis on the fax message dated 26th August,1998 addressed by the Oil Co-ordination Committee to the oil companies,including the appellant,inter alia,informing them that no further extension of the Current Charter Hire Rate will be allowed,learned counsel submitted that the said message made it clear to all concerned that Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 would not be extended under any circumstance",2
29,"Shyam Divan,learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent,on the other hand,submitted that notwithstanding the fact that the period fixed originally under the Charter Party or under the Addendum dated 29th June,1998 had come to an end,the subsequent conduct of the parties goes to show that charter of the vessel by the appellant beyond 31st August,1998 continued to be governed by the terms and conditions stipulated in charter party dated 6th May,1997 and,therefore,an arbitration agreement did exist between the parties",2
29,"Learned counsel argued that even otherwise till the vessel was not re-delivered in terms of Cls.4 and 23 of Charter Party dated 6th May,1997,the said agreement could not come to an end",2
29,"It was pointed out that all the obligations of the owners as well as of the charterers during the period the vessel was in use continued to be discharged under the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 even after the expiry of the period of the Charter Party",2
29,"In support of the proposition that the concurrence of a party can be gathered from his conduct,like continued user of the vessel in the present case,without any objection to respondent s letter dated 4th January,1999,reliance is placed on a decision of this Court in The Godhra Electricity Co",2
29,Ltd.& Anr,2
29,Vs,2
29,The State of Gujarat & Anr 1974 Indlaw SC 253,2
29,"It was also submitted that the view taken by the High Court being a plausible view,interference in exercise of extra-ordinary jurisdiction u/art.136 of the Constitution is unwarranted",2
29,"Thus,the short question for determination is whether on the expiry of the extended period of charter hire on 31st August,1998,Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 came to an end and the arbitration agreement between the parties perished with it",1
29,"Before we proceed to examine the rival stands,we may note,at the outset,that neither the Arbitral Tribunal nor the High Court have gone into the question whether the claim made by the respondent would otherwise fall within the ambit of the arbitration clause in the Charter Party or not",1
29,"What is in dispute is whether the arbitration agreement between the parties had got extinguished after 31st August,1998,i.e.the date of expiry of the extended period of the Charter Party",1
29,"Therefore,we refrain from expressing any opinion on the scope and ambit of the arbitration clause though,prime facie,it appears to be quite widely worded",1
29,"It is,no doubt,true that the general rule is that an offer is not accepted by mere silence on the part of the offerree,yet it does not mean that an acceptance always has to be given in so many words",1
29,"Under certain circumstances,offerree s silence,coupled with his conduct,which takes the form of a positive act,may constitute an acceptance an agreement sub silentio",1
29,"Therefore,the terms of a contract between the parties can be proved not only by their words but also by their conduct",1
29,"In our view,the principle of sub silentio is clearly attracted in the present case",1
29,"As noted above,after the extended period of Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 had come to an end on 31st August,1998",1
29,"and the bids received pursuant to fresh invitation were pending finalization,vide their letter dated 12th",1
29,"October,1998,the respondent had informed the appellant that they were agreeable to apply new rates for use of the vessel from 1st July,1998 provided all the nine vessels are used",1
29,"However,on 31st October,1998,the appellant faxed IOC s message informing them of the extension of the existing coastal tanker fleet for the month of October,1998 at reduced rates,viz.80% of the Charter Party rates prevailing till 30th August,1998.On receipt of the said letter,the respondent vide their letter dated 5th November,1998,protested against the revision of the rates for the vessel not being considered under the new bid and stated in unequivocal terms that it was not possible for them to accept the proposal of the Oil Co-ordination Committee,communicated to them vide letter dated 12th",1
29,"October,1998.Yet again while responding to appellant s fax dated 31st December,1998,whereby the respondent was required to sign a provisional charter party by 4th January,1999,vide their letter dated 4th January,1999,the respondent,pointed out to the appellant that usual practice is that pending finalization of the new Charter,the existing terms and conditions of the Charter Party continue to apply and,therefore,they were willing to sign the agreement as contemplated by the appellant based on the existing terms and conditions",1
29,"It was suggested that an agreement may be signed between them for the period from 1st September,1998 until the matter was finally decided by the appellant under the tender,on the existing terms and conditions with the charter hire being provisionally paid on ad hoc basis at 90% of the rate which was prevailing under the existing Charter Party",1
29,"As noted hereinabove,there was no response by the appellant to respondent s letter dated 4th January,1999 though it appears that vide their letter of even date,the appellant did suggest to the respondent that as a token of formal agreement the said letter may be jointly signed by the charterers and the vessel owners",1
29,"Admittedly,no such agreement was signed between the parties",1
29,"Indubitably,there was no further exchange of correspondence between the parties during the year",1
29,"Nevertheless,the appellant continued to use the vessel on hire with them under the time charter dated 6th May,1997.The conduct of the parties,as evidenced in the said correspondence and,in particular appellant s silence on respondent s letters dated 5th November,1998 and 4th",1
29,"January,1999,coupled with the fact that they continued to use the vessel,manifestly goes to show that except for the charter rate,there was no other dispute between the parties",1
29,"They accepted the stand of the respondent sub silentio and thus,continued to bind themselves by other terms and conditions contained in the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997,which obviously included the arbitration clause",1
29,"We may examine the issue from another angle,based on respondent s stand that charter party dated 6th May,1997 continues to be in vogue till the chartered vessel is re-delivered",1
29,"In this context,it would be appropriate to refer to Cls.4 and 23 of the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997.These are in the following terms: ""4.Delivery & Redelivery 4.1",0
29,The vessel shall continue to be on charter to charterers in direct continuation from 2348 hrs.22.09.1996 to 30.06.1998.The vessel shall be re-delivered by charterers to owners on dropping last outward pilot at any port on west coast of India at charterers option,0
29,Charterers to give owners 15 days notice to probable port of re-delivery,0
29,4.2 Charterers to load last three cargoes clean and re-deliver the vessel in clean condition,0
29,"Final Voyage Should the vessel be on her voyage towards the port of redelivery at the time of payment of hire is due,payment of hire shall be made for such length of time as Owners and Charterers may agree upon as being estimated time necessary to complete the voyage,less any disbursements made or expected to be made or expenses incurred or expected to be incurred by Charterers for owners account and less the estimated amount of bunker fuel remaining at the termination of the voyage and when the vessel is redelivered any overpayment shall be refunded by the owners or underpayment paid by Charterers",1
29,"Notwithstanding the provisions of cl.4 hereof should the vessel be upon voyage at the expiry of the period of this charter,Charterers shall have the use of vessel at the same rate and conditions for such extended time as may be necessary for the completion of the round voyage on which she is engaged and her return to a port of redelivery as provided by the Charter",1
29,"On a conjoint reading of the said clauses,it is plain that the appellant was under an obligation to re-deliver the vessel as per the procedure contemplated in the afore-noted clauses",1
29,"Indisputably,the vessel in question had not been re-delivered at least during the relevant period and the appellant continued to use the vessel beyond 31st August,1998.Having failed to re-deliver the vessel in terms of Cl.4.1 of the Charter Party,the appellant cannot plead that the Charter Party had been fully worked out",1
29,"It is clear from the pleadings and issue No.2,framed by the Arbitral Tribunal,that it was respondent s consistent stand that since the hired vessel had not been re-delivered at the end of the time charter party,the vessel would be governed by the terms and conditions in the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997",1
29,"However,the Arbitral Tribunal answered the said issue against the respondent",1
29,It appears to us that even the question in regard to the effect and consequences of non-delivery of the vessel in terms of the Cl.4.1 and 23 would by itself be a dispute arising under the said Charter Party .With,1
29,respect,1
29,the learned Arbitral Tribunal overlooked this aspect of the matter,1
29,"We are,therefore,of the opinion that though performance of the Charter Party agreement dated 6th May,1997 may have come to an end on 31st August,1998",4
29,"but it was still in existence for some purposes,viz.the effect of vessel s non re-delivery as per the prescribed mechanism and its continued use beyond the stipulated time",4
29,"and,thus,the arbitration clause in the said Charter Party operated in respect of these and other allied purposes",4
29,"Therefore,the factual scenario in the instant case leads to an inescapable conclusion that notwithstanding the expiry of the period fixed in the time charter party dated 6th May,1997,the said charter party did not get extinguished,inter alia,for the purpose of determination of the disputes arising thereunder and the arbitration clause contained therein could be invoked by the respondent",4
29,"In view of the foregoing discussion,we do not find any infirmity in the view taken by the High Court that Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 had not come to an end by efflux of time and it got extended by the conduct of the parties,warranting interference",4
29,"Having come to the conclusion that an arbitration agreement existed between the parties,the question which remains to be considered is whether the disputes between the parties should be referred to the same Arbitral Tribunal which had come to the conclusion that in the absence of any arbitration agreement it did not have jurisdiction to entertain and try the claims and counter claims",1
29,We feel that it would be proper and expedient to constitute a fresh Arbitral Tribunal,4
29,"Accordingly,we constitute an Arbitral Tribunal consisting of Justice M.Jagannadha Rao (Presiding Arbitrator),Justice D.P.Wadhwa and Justice S.N.Variava,former Judges of this Court to adjudicate upon the claim/counter claim by the parties,subject to their consent and such terms and conditions as they may deem fit and proper",4
29,It goes without saying that the learned Tribunal shall deal with the matter uninfluenced by any observations in this order on the respective stands of the parties,4
29,"Resultantly,the appeal being devoid of any merit is liable to be dismissed,which we do,leaving the parties to bear their own costs",1
29,The Registry is directed to communicate this order to the learned Members of the Arbitral Tribunal to enable them to enter upon the Reference and decide the matter as expeditiously as practicable,4
29,Appeal dismissed,4
31,"This appeal, by special leave, has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 23 February 2005 of Bombay High Court (Aurangabad Bench), by which the appeal preferred by the appellants was dismissed and their conviction under Section 304-B read with Section 34 IPC and sentence of 7 years RI imposed thereunder by the learned Sessions Judge, Aurangabad, was affirmed",6
31,The deceased Bhimabai was daughter of PW.1 Tukaram Eknath Tambe resident of village Sanjkheda,6
31,and she was married to appellant no. 1,6
31,Appasaheb son of Sheshrao Palaskar about two and half years prior to the date of incident which took place on 15 September 1991,6
31,"The appellant no. 2, Kadubai is the mother of the appellant no. 1 and both the appellants were residing in the same house in village Palshi",6
31,"According to the case of prosecution, a sum of Rs",6
31,5000 and some gold ornaments had been given at the time of marriage of Bhimabai,6
31,For about six months Bhimabai was treated well but thereafter the accused started asking her to bring Rs,6
31,"1,000-1,200 from her parents to meet the household expenses and also for purchasing manure",6
31,"Whenever Bhimabai went to her parental home, she used to tell her parents that her husband and mother-in-law (accused appellants) were harassing her and used to occasionally beat her",6
31,Her father PW.1 Tukaram along with some of his relatives went to the house of the accused and tried to persuade them not to ill-treat Bhimabai,6
31,"Thereafter, the accused treated Bhimabai properly but after about four months they again started harassing her",6
31,"A few days before Nag Panchami festival Bhimabai came to her parental home and complained that the accused were not giving her proper food, clothing and even footwear",6
31,"She also told her parents that her husband had asked her to bring an amount of Rs.1,000-1,200 for the purpose of household expenses and manure",6
31,The case of the prosecution futher is that in the evening of 15 September 1991 a person came from village Palshi on a motorcycle and informed PW.1 Tukaram that Bhimabai was unwell,6
31,PW.1 then immediately went to the house of the accused along with some of his relatives,6
31,There he saw that Bhimabai was lying dead and froth was coming out of her mouth which indicated that she had consumed some poisonous substance,6
31,The Police Patil of the village PW.3 Sandu Mohanrao Patil lodged an accidental death report at 9.00 p.m. on 15 September 1991 at the police station,6
31,"On the basis of the said accidental death report, PW.6 Sandeepan Kamble, Police Sub-Inspector, visited the house of the accused, held inquest on the dead body of Bhimabai, and thereafter sent the same for post-mortem examination",6
31,"PW.1 Tukaram lodged the FIR of the incident at 7.00 p.m. on 16 September 1991 at P.S. Chikalthana, on the basis of which Case Crime No. 144 of 1991 was registered against the appellants under Sections 498-A, 306 and 304-B IPC",6
31,"After completion of investigation, charge sheet was submitted against the appellants and in due course, the case was committed to the Court of Sessions",6
31,"The learned Sessions Judge framed charges under Sections 498-A, 304-B read with Section 34 IPC and Section 306 read with Section 34 IPC against both the appellants",6
31,The appellants pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried,6
31,The prosecution in order to establish its case examined six wintesses and filed some documentary evidence,6
31,The learned Sessions Judge after consideration of the material on record acquitted the appellants of the charges under Sections 498-A and 306 read with Section 34 IPC but convicted them under Section 304-B IPC and imposed a sentence of 7 years RI thereunder,3
31,The appeal preferred by the appellants was dismissed by the High Court by the judgment and order dated 23 February 2005,3
31,"We have heard learned counsel for the appellants, learned counsel for the State of Maharashtra and have perused the records",6
31,"The post-mortem examination on the body of deceased Bhimabai was conducted by a team of two doctors of Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, Medical College, Aurangabad, namely, Dr. S.M. Jawale and Dr. H.V. Godbole on 16 September 1991",6
31,"The doctors did not find any sign of external or internal injury on the body of the deceased and in their opinion, the cause of death was insecticide poisoning",6
31,The viscera were preserved for chemical analysis,6
31,The report of the post-mortem examination was admitted by the defence,6
31,The specific case of the prosecution is that Bhimabai ended her life by consuming poison because of harassment caused to her by the appellants for or in connection with demand of dowry,6
31,"It is, therefore, necessary to briefly examine the evidence of the prosecution witnesses",6
31,PW,6
31,"1 Tukaram, father of the deceased, has given details of the prosecution version of the incident in his statement in Court",6
31,"He has deposed that in the marriage he had given Rs. 20,000 as dowry",6
31,"Initially, Bhimabai was treated well for about six months, but thereafter the appellants started ill-treating her",6
31,"Whenever Bhimabai came to her parental home, she used to complain that for some domestic reasons she was being harassed",6
31,"When she had visited her parental home on the last occasion, she had said that her husband Appasaheb had asked her to bring Rs",6
31,"1,000-1,200 for domestic expenses and for purchasing manure as he had no sufficient money",6
31,"Bhimabai had complained to him that she was not being given proper food, clothings and even footwear and occasionally the appellant no. 1 used to beat her",6
31,The last time she visited her parental home was during the festival of Nag Panchami and at that time she looked depressed,6
31,"The witness has further deposed that on the date of incident, a man came from village Palshi on motorcycle and informed that he should immediately go there as Bhimabai was not well",6
31,He then went to village Palshi along with other persons of his family where he reached after sun set,6
31,He saw that Bhimabai was lying dead and froth was coming out of her mouth which was smelling of Thimet (insecticide,6
31,"In his cross- examination he has admitted that his statement that he had given Rs.20,000 in dowry at the time of marriage was incorrect and in fact he had given Rs",6
31,"5,000 as dowry and the total expenses incurred in the marriage was about Rs",6
31,"20,000",6
31,He has also deposed that it was after about 1-1/2 years of marriage that Bhimabai first complained to him about the harassment being caused to her,6
31,There used to be some bickering in the marital life of Bhimabai and her husband on trifling matters,6
31,He has admitted that it was appellant no,6
31,1 who had sent a person on motorcycle who had given information regarding Bhimabai being unwell and that both the appellants were present at the time of her funeral,6
31,PW.2 Babaji is real brother of father-in-law of PW.1 Tukaram,6
31,He has deposed that on an earlier occasion he had gone along with PW.1 and some others to the house of appellant no.1 to persuade him not to harass Bhimabai and to treat her well,6
31,"In his cross- examination he has admitted that when he had gone to village Palshi to talk with the appellants regarding the ill-treatment being meted out to Bhimabai, there was no talk regarding monetary giving and taking",6
31,He also admitted that he had not gone to attend that funeral of Bhimabai,6
31,PW.5 Sumanbai is the mother of the deceased Bhimabai,6
31,She has stated in her examination-in-chief that Bhimabai was being ill-treated by the appellants and the reason for ill-treatment was that they were demanding money to be brought from her parental home,6
31,The last time Bhimabai visited her parental home was on the occasion of the festival of Nag Panchami and she had complained that she was being ill-treated and was sometimes given beating for bringing money from her parents,6
31,"She has specifically stated that for a period of six months after the marriage, Bhimabai was treated well and thereafter she had started complaining about the harassment being caused to her",6
31,"In her cross-examination, PW.5 Sumanbai has stated that after news about the condition of Bhimabai was given by a man from village Palshi, she along with her husband and some other relations went there and noticed that Bhimabai was lying dead in the house and froth was coming out of her mouth",6
31,She has further stated that she did not make any enquiry as to how Bhimabai had died,6
31,In her statement under Section 161 Cr,6
31,"P.C. which was recorded very next day of the incident i.e. on 16 September 1991 she did not state that cause of ill-treatment was ""a demand for money and a consequent beating",6
31,When confronted with her aforesaid statement under Section 161 Cr,6
31,P.C,1
31,"she replied that she did not know why there was no mention in the said statement that the cause for ill-treatment was ""a demand for money and a consequent beating",6
31,"She further stated that it will be correct to say that her daughter was receiving ill-treatment as a result of ""domestic cause",6
31,The learned trial Judge then sought clarification from the witnesses by putting the following question,6
31,Que,6
31,"What do you mean by ""domestic cause",6
31,Ans,6
31,What I meant was that there was demand for money for defraying expenses of manure etc,6
31,and that was the cause,6
31,"In the very next paragraph she stated as under :- ""It is not true to suggest that in my statement before the police I never said that ill-treatment was as a result of demand for money from us and its fulfillment",6
31,I cannot assign any reason why police did not write about it in my statement,6
31,"3 Sandu, Police Patil of village Palshi has deposed that at about 4.20 p.m. on 15 September 1991, Narayan who is uncle of appellant no.1, Appasaheb, informed him that the wife of Appasaheb had expired",6
31,He then went to the house of the appellant and saw Bhimabai lying with froth coming out of her mouth,6
31,"Thereafter, he gave a report about the incident in writing at the police station",6
31,"In his cross-examination, he admitted that he did not make detailed enquiries as to what was the cause of death and where the incident had taken place",6
31,"He has further deposed that Bhimabai had come to his house about six months earlier and had said all was not well between her and her husband, but she had not given any specific details",6
31,"The main witnesses regarding the alleged demand of money and also harassment and beating to Bhimabai are her father and mother, viz",1
31,PW.1 Tukaram and PW.5 Sumanbai,1
31,"In his examination-in-chief PW.1 has said that whenever his daughter came to her parental home, she used to complain that she was being subjected to harassment by the appellants on account of some ""domestic reasons"" and further that her husband (appellant no.1) had told her that while coming back from her parental home she should bring Rs",1
31,"1,000-1,200 for expenses and for manure as he had no sufficient money",1
31,"PW.5 Sumanbai has deposed that Bhimabai was receiving ill-treatment as a result of ""domestic cause"" and to a specific question put by the Court as to what she meant by ""domestic cause"" she gave a reply that there was a demand for money for defraying expenses of manure etc",1
31,It is important to note that in her statement under Section 161 Cr,1
31,"P.C. which was recorded on the very next day of the death of Bhimabai, this witness did not state that the cause for ill-treatment was ""a demand for money and a consequent beating",1
31,The evidence on record does not indicate that the police had any reason to favour the accused and deliberately omitted to mention about the alleged demand of money while recording the statement of PW.5 Sumanbai under Section 161 Cr,1
31,"The evidence shows that the accused come from very humble background and they could not have exerted any kind of influence, financial or otherwise, upon the police so as to manage a statement favourable to them when in the course of investigation the statements of witnesses were being recorded under Section 161 Cr",1
31,Accepting the statements of father and mother on their face value that utmost which can be held is that the appellant no.1 had asked his wife Bhimabai to bring money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure,1
31,"Two essential ingredient of Section 304-B IPC, apart from others, are (i) death of women is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances, and (ii) women is subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for ""dowry",0
31,"The explanation appended to sub-section (1) of Section 304-B IPC says that ""dowry"" shall have the same meaning as in Section 2 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961",0
31,"Section 2 of Dowry Prohibition Act reads as under :- ""2. Definition of ""dowry"" - In this Act ""dowry"" means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly- (a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage; or (b) by the parent of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person, at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties, but does not include dowry or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law (shariat) applies",0
31,"In view of the aforesaid definition of the word ""dowry"" any property or valuable security should be given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly at or before or any time after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties",1
31,"Therefore, the giving or taking of property or valuable security must have some connection with the marriage of the parties and a correlation between the giving or taking of property or valuable security with the marriage of the parties is essential",1
31,Being a penal provision it has to be strictly construed,1
31,Dowry is a fairly well known social custom or practice in India,1
31,"It is well settled principle of interpretation of Statute that if the Act is passed with reference to a particular trade, business or transaction and words are used which everybody conversant with that trade, business or transaction knows or understands to have a particular meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning",1
31,"See Union of India v. Garware Nylons Ltd., AIR (1996",1
31,"SC 3509 1996 Indlaw SC 2404 and Chemicals and Fibres of India v. Union of India, AIR (1997",1
31,SC 558 1991 Indlaw SC 861,1
31,A demand for money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses of for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry as the said word is normally understood,1
31,"The evidence adduced by the prosecution does not, therefore, show that any demand for ""dowry"" as defined in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act was made by the appellants as what was allegedly asked for was some money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure",1
31,Since an essential ingredient of Section 304-B IPC viz,1
31,"demand for dowry is not established, the conviction of the appellants cannot be sustained",1
31,Learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that there is absolutely no evidence either direct or circumstantial to show that Bhimabai committed suicide,2
31,He has submitted that the insecticide Thimet is extensively used by the farmers for preservation of crop and is kept stored in their houses and it could be a case where Thimet accidentally got mixed with some food item and was consumed by Bhaimabai,2
31,It has thus been submitted that no offence under Section 306 IPC is made out against the appellants,2
31,We do not consider it necessary to examine this question,1
31,"As already stated, the appellants were also charged under Sections 498-A and 306 read with Section 34 IPC but were acquitted of the said charges by the learned Sessions Judge, which order has attained finality for the reason that the State did not prefer appeal against the same",1
31,The appeal before the High Court and also in this Court has been preferred by the appellants challenging their conviction under section 304-B read with section 34 IPC,1
31,"It has been held in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Thadi Narayan, AIR (1962",5
31,"SC 240 1961 Indlaw SC 171 that Section 423(1)(b)(i) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (which corresponds to Section 386(b)(i) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973) is clearly confined to cases of appeals preferred against orders of conviction and sentence, the powers conferred by this clause cannot be exercised for the purpose of reversing an order of acquittal passed in favour of a party in respect of an offence charged, in dealing with an appeal preferred by him against the order of conviction in respect of another offence charged and found proved",5
31,"Therefore, we have refrained from expressing any opinion as to whether the appellants could be held guilty of having committed the offence under Section 498-A or 306 IPC on the basis of evidence available on record as their acquittal under the aforesaid charges has attained finality and cannot be reversed in the appeal filed by the appellants challenging their conviction under Section 304-B IPC",1
31,"In view of the discussion made above, the appeal is allowed",4
31,The judgment and order dated 23 February 2005 of the High Court and the judgment and order dated 04 January 1993 of the learned Sessions Judge convicting the appellants under Section 304-B IPC are set aside and the appellants are acquitted of the said charge,4
31,The appellant no.1 is in custody,4
31,He shall be released forthwith unless wanted in some other case,4
31,The appellant no. 2 is on bail,4
31,The sureties and bail bonds furnished by her are discharged,4
31,Appeal allowed,4
35,Leave granted,6
35,Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court dismissing the writ appeal filed by the appellant on the ground that it was not maintainable,6
35,"The appeal was filed u/s.2(1) of the M.P.Uchacha Nyayalay (Khand Nyaypeth Ko Appeal) Adhiniyam,2005",6
35,"hereinafter referred to as the 'Act').It was held that the order was passed in exercise of power of superintendence u/art.227 of the Constitution of India,1950 (in short the 'Constitution') against which the Letters Patent Appeal is not maintainable",6
35,"The order of learned Single Judge was passed on 9.11.2005.Against the said order,special leave petition was filed which was disposed of by this Court by order dated 16.2.2006.We shall refer to the text of the order later",6
35,The High Court construed as if this Court has only waived the limitation for filing of Letters Patent Appeal and there was no direction to consider the case on merits,6
35,Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the order of this Court is very clear and the conclusions of the High Court that merely limitation was waived is contrary to the clear terms of the earlier order of this Court,2
35,"Additionally it is submitted that the prayer in the Writ Petition was to quash the order passed by the Assistant Commissioner,Commercial Tax",2
35,"That being so,the mere fact that the writ petition was styled u/art.227 of the Constitution is of no consequence",1
35,It is the nature of the relief sought for and the controversy involved which determines the Article which is applicable,1
35,Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand supported the impugned judgment of the High Court,1
35,"The earlier order passed by this Court dated 22.8.2006 reads as follows: ""Heard",6
35,Since the impugned order is passed by a learned Single Judge,6
35,The normal remedy is to file a Letters Patent Appeal,6
35,Since we had entertained the Special Leave Petition against the learned Single Judge's order it would be appropriate to grant three weeks' time to the petitioner to prefer the LPA which if otherwise free from defect shall be entertained for being considered on merits,6
35,The interim order passed by this Court shall continue for the aforesaid purpose,6
35,The Special Leave Petition is disposed of accordingly,6
35,Underlined for emphasis,6
35,A bare reading of the order shows that the direction was to consider the LPA on merits and time was granted to prefer the LPA within three weeks,1
35,The High Court was directed to dispose of the LPA on merits if it was otherwise free from defect,1
35,"The High Court was,therefore,not justified in holding that this Court's earlier order only waived the limitation for filing a Letters Patent Appeal",1
35,On that score alone the High Court's order is unsustainable,1
35,"In addition,the High Court seems to have gone by the nomenclature gone by the nomenclature i.e.the discription given in the writ petition to be one u/art.227 of the Constitution",1
35,The High Court did not consider the nature of the controversy and the prayer involved in the Writ petition,1
35,"As noted above the prayer was to quash the order of assessment passed by the Assistant Commissioner,Commercial Tax levying purchase as well as Entry Tax",1
35,"S.2 of the Act reads as follows: ""2(1",0
35,"An appeal shall lie from a judgment or order passed by the one Judge of the High Court in exercise of original jurisdiction u/art.226 of the Constitution of India,to a Division bench comprising of two judges of the same High Court",0
35,Provided that no such appeal shall lie against an interlocutory order or against an order passed in exercise of supervisory jurisdiction u/art.227 of the Constitution of India,0
35,This Court in Hari Vishnu Kamath v,5
35,Syed Ahmad Ishaque and Ors.(AIR 1955 SC 233 1954 Indlaw SC 212) held that the High Court while issuing writ of certiorari u/art.226 of the Constitution can only annul a decision of a Tribunal whereas u/art.227 of the Constitution it can issue further directions as well,5
35,As noted above the prayer in the Writ Petition was to set aside the decision of the assessing officer,6
35,In Umaji Keshao Meshram v,5
35,Radhikabai [AIR 1986 SC 1272 1986 Indlaw SC 651,5
35,it was noted as follows,5
35,"U/art.226 an order,direction or writ is to issue to a person,authority or the State",5
35,"In a proceeding under that article the person,authority or State against whom the direction,order or writ is sought is a necessary party",5
35,"Under Article 227,however,what comes up before the High Court is the order or judgment of a subordinate court or tribunal for the purpose of ascertaining whether in giving such judgment or order that subordinate court or tribunal has acted within its authority and according to law",5
35,"Prior to the commencement of the Constitution,the Chartered High Courts as also the Judicial Committee had held that the power to issue prerogative writs possessed by the Chartered High Courts was an exercise of original jurisdiction (see Mahomedalli Allabux v",5

35,"the Judicial Committee held: ""In Their Lordships' opinion any original civil jurisdiction possessed by the High Court and not in express terms conferred by the Letters Patent or later enactments falls within the description of ordinary original civil jurisdiction",5
35,By Art.226 the power of issuing prerogative writs possessed by the Chartered High Courts prior to the commencement of the Constitution has been made wider and more extensive and conferred upon every High Court,1
35,"The nature of the exercise of the power under Article 226,however,remains the same as in the case of the power of issuing prerogative writs possessed by the Chartered High Courts",1

35,It was noted as follows,5
35,"The non obstante clause in Rule 18,namely,""Notwithstanding anything contained in Rules 1,4 and 17 of this chapter"",makes it abundantly clear why that rule uses the words ""finally disposed of"".As seen above,under Rules 1 and 17,applications u/arts.226 and 227 are required to be heard and disposed of by a Division Bench",5
35,"Rule 4,however,gives power to a Single Judge to issue rule nisi on an application u/art.226",5
35,but precludes him from passing any final order on such application,5
35,"It is because a Single Judge has no power under Rules 1,4 and 17 to hear and dispose of a petition u",5
35,"art.226 or 227 that the non obstante clause has been introduced in Rule 18.The use of the words ""be heard and finally disposed of by a Single Judge"" in Rule 18 merely clarifies the position that in such cases the power of the Single Judge is not confined merely to issuing a rule nisi",5
35,These words were not intended to bar a right of appeal,5
35,"To say that the words ""finally disposed of"" mean finally disposed of so far as the High Court is concerned is illogical because Rules 1,4 and 7 use the words ""be heard and disposed of by a Divisional Bench"" and were the reasoning of the Full Bench correct,it would mean that so far as the High Court is concerned,when a Single Judge hears a matter and disposes it of,it is finally disposed of and when a Division Bench disposes it of,it is not finally disposed of",5
35,The right of appeal against the judgment of a Single Judge is given by the Letters Patent which have been continued in force by Art.225 of the Constitution,5
35,"If under the Rules of the High Court,a matter is heard and disposed of by a Single Judge,an appeal lies against his judgment unless it is barred either under the Letters Patent or some other enactment",5
35,"The word ""finally"" used in Rule 18 of Chapter XVII of the Appellate Side Rules does not and cannot possibly have the effect of barring a right of appeal conferred by the Letters Patent",5
35,"As we have seen above,an intra-court appeal against the judgment of a Single Judge in a petition u/art.226 is not barred while cl.15 itself bars an intra-court appeal against the judgment of a Single Judge in a petition u/art.227",5

35,Nihalchand Waghajibhai Shaha [1993 Supp.(1) SCC 11 1991 Indlaw SC 718,5
35,this court with reference to an unreported judgment in Ratnagiri District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd.v,5
35,"Dinkar Kashinath Watve 1989 Indlaw SC 421,C.A.No.520 of 1989 decided on 27.1.1989 held as follows: ""Even when in the cause title of an application both Art.226 and Art.227 of the Constitution have been mentioned,the learned single Judge is at liberty to decide,according to facts of each particular case,whether the said application ought to be dealt with only u/art.226 of the Constitution",5
35,For determining the question of maintainability of an appeal against such a judgment of the Single Judge the Division bench has to find out whether in substance the judgment has been passed by the learned Single Judge in exercise of the jurisdiction u/art.226 of the Constitution,5
35,"In the event in passing his judgment on an application which had mentioned in its cause title both Arts.226 and 227,the Single Judge has in fact invoked only his supervisory powers under Article 227,the appeal under cl.15 would not lie",5
35,The cl.15 of the Letters Patent expressly bars appeals against orders of Single Judges passed under revisional or supervisory powers,5
35,"Even when the learned Single Judge's order has been passed under both the articles,for deciding the maintainability against such an order what would be relevant is the principal or main relief granted by the judgment passed by learned Single Judge and not the ancillary directions given by him",5
35,"The expression 'ancillary' means,in the context,incidental or consequential to the main part of the order",5
35,"Thus,the determining factor is the real nature of principal order passed by the Single Judge which is appealed against and neither the mentioning in the cause title of the application of both the articles nor the granting of ancillary orders thereupon made by learned Single Judge would be relevant",5
35,"Thus,in each case,the Division Bench may consider the substance of the judgment under appeal to ascertain whether the Single Judge has mainly or principally exercised in the matter his jurisdiction",5
35,u/art.226 or u/art.227.In,5
35,"the event in his judgment the learned Single Judge himself had mentioned the particular article of the Constitution under which he was passing his judgment,in an appeal under cl.15 against such a judgment it may not be necessary for the appellate bench to elaborately examine the question of its maintainability",5
35,"When without mentioning the particular article the learned Single Judge decided on merits the application,in order to decide the question of maintainability of an appeal,against such a judgment,the Division Bench might examine the relief granted by the learned Single Judge,for maintainability of an appeal,the determination would be the main and not the ancillary relief",5
35,"When a combined application u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution is summarily dismissed without reasons,the appeal Court may consider whether the facts alleged,warranted filing of the application u/art.226 or u/art.227 of the Constitution",5
35,"Thereafter this Court explained the ratio laid down in the case of Umaji's case1986 Indlaw SC 651 (supra) and expressed thus: ""In Umaji case it was clearly held that where the facts justify a party in filing an application either u/art.226 or 227 of the Constitution of India and the party chooses to file his application under both these articles in fairness of justice to party and in order not to deprive him of valuable right of appeal the Court ought to treat the application as being made under Article 226,and if in deciding the matter,in the final order the Court gives ancillary directions which may pertain to Article 227,this ought not to be held to deprive a party of the right of appeal under cl.15 of the Letters Patent where the substantial part of the order sought to be appealed against is u/art.226.Rule 18 of the Bombay High Court Appellate Side Rules read with cl.15 of the Letters Patent provides for appeal to the Division Bench of the High Court from a judgment of the learned Single Judge passed on a writ petition u/art.226 of the Constitution",5
35,In the present case the Division Bench was clearly wrong in holding that the appeal was not maintainable against the order of the learned Single Judge,5
35,In Mangalbhai & Ors.v,5
35,Radhyshyam (Dr,5
35,"AIR 1993 SC 806 1992 Indlaw SC 509] it was inter alia observed as follows: ""The learned Single Judge in his impugned judgment dated December 11,1987 nowhere mentioned that he was exercising the powers u/art.227 of the Constitution",5
35,The learned Single Judge examined the matter on merit and set aside the orders of the Rent Controller as well as the Resident Deputy Collector on the ground that the aforesaid judgments were perverse,5
35,The findings of the Rent Controller and Resident Deputy Collector were set aside on the question of habitual defaulter as well as on the ground of bona fide need,5
35,"Thus in the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case,the pleadings of the parties in the writ petition and the judgment of the learned Single Judge leaves no manner of doubt that it was an order passed u/art.226 of the Constitution and in that view of the matter the Letters Patent Appeal was maintainable before the High Court",5
35,After taking the aforesaid view one course open was to set aside the order of the Division Bench and to remand the matter for being disposed of on merits by the Division Bench of the High Court,5
35,"However,taking in view the fact that this litigation is going on for nearly a decade and also the fact that even the learned Single Judge in his impugned order dated December 11,1987 had remanded the case to the Rent Controller,we considered it proper in the interest of justice to hear the appeal on merits against the judgment of the learned Single Judge",5
35,We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length on the merits of the case,5
35,In Lokmat Newspapers (P,5
35,Shankarprasad [1999 (6) SCC 275 1999 Indlaw SC 587,5
35,"it was observed as follows: ""It is,therefore,obvious that the writ petition invoking jurisdiction of the High Court both u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution had tried to make out a case for the High Court's interference seeking issuance of an appropriate writ of certiorari u/art.226 of the Constitution of India",5
35,Basic averments for invoking such a jurisdiction were already pleaded in the writ petition for the High Court's consideration,5
35,"It is true,as submitted by learned counsel for the appellant,that the order of the learned Single Judge nowhere stated that the Court was considering the writ petition u/art.226 of the Constitution of India",5
35,It is equally true that the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition by observing that the courts below had appreciated the contentions and rejected the complaint,5
35,But the said observation of the learned Single Judge did not necessarily mean that the learned Judge was not inclined to interfere u/art.227 of the Constitution of India only,5
35,"The said observation equally supports the conclusion that the learned Judge was not inclined to interfere u/arts.226 and 227.As seen earlier,he was considering the aforesaid writ petition moved u/art.226 as well as Art.227 of the Constitution of India",5
35,"Under these circumstances,it is not possible to agree with the contention of learned counsel for the appellant that the learned Single Judge had refused to interfere only u/art.227 of the Constitution of India when he dismissed the writ petition of the respondent",5
35,"In this connection,it is profitable to have a look at the decision of this Court in the case of Umaji Keshao Meshram v",5
35,Radhikabai [1986 Supp.SCC 401 1986 Indlaw SC 651].In,5
35,that case O.Chinnappa Reddy and D.P.Madon,5
35,"JJ.,considered the very same question in the light of cl.15 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court",5
35,"Madon,J.,speaking for the Court  made the following pertinent observations: ""Petitions are at times filed both u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution",5
35,The case of Hari Vishnu Kamath v,5
35,Syed Ahmad Ishaque (AIR 1955 SC 233 1954 Indlaw SC 212) before this Court was of such a type,5
35,"Rule 18 provides that where such petitions are filed against orders of the tribunals or authorities specified in Rule 18 of Chapter XVII of the Appellate Side Rules or against decrees or orders of courts specified in that rule,they shall be heard and finally disposed of by a Single Judge",5
35,The question is whether an appeal would lie from the decision of the Single Judge in such a case,5
35,"In our opinion,where the facts justify a party in filing an application either u/art.226 or 227 of the Constitution,and the party chooses to file his application under both these articles,in fairness and justice to such party and in order not to deprive him of the valuable right of appeal the court ought to treat the application as being made under Article 226,and if in deciding the matter,in the final order the court gives ancillary directions which may pertain to Article 227,this ought not to be held to deprive a party of the right of appeal under cl.15 of the Letters Patent where the substantial part of the order sought to ^*296be appealed against is u",5

35,Peoples' Coop,5
35,Transport Society Ltd.(AIR 1961 Punj 24 1960 Indlaw PNH 196) and we are in agreement with it,5
35,The aforesaid decision squarely gets attracted on the facts of the present case,1
35,It was open to the respondent to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court both u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution of India,1
35,"Once such a jurisdiction was invoked and when his writ petition was dismissed on merits,it cannot be said that the learned Single Judge had exercised his jurisdiction only u/art.226  of the Constitution of India",1
35,"This conclusion directly flows from the relevant averments made in the writ petition and the nature of jurisdiction invoked by the respondent as noted by the learned Single Judge in his judgment,as seen earlier",1
35,"Consequently,it could not be said that cl.15 of the Letters Patent was not attracted for preferring appeal against the judgment of the learned Single Judge",1
35,It is also necessary to note that the appellant being the respondent in letters patent appeal joined issues on merits and did not take up the contention that the letters patent appeal was not maintainable,1
35,"For all these reasons,therefore,the primary objection to the maintainability of the letters patent appeal as canvassed by learned counsel for the appellant,has to be repelled",1
35,"Point 1 is,therefore,answered in the affirmative against the appellant and in favour of the respondent",1
35,It takes us to the consideration of points arising for our decision on merits,1

35,"Ashok Hurra [AIR 2002 SC 1771 2002 Indlaw SC 1966],this Court held as follows: ""From the aforesaid enunciation of law it is quite vivid and luminescent that the pleadings in the writ petition,nature of the order passed by the learned Single Judge,character and the contour of the order,directions issued,nomenclature given the jurisdictional prospective in the Constitutional context are to be perceived",5
35,"It cannot be said in a hypertechnical manner that an order passed in a writ petition,if there is assail to the order emerging from the inferior tribunal or subordinate Court has to be treated all the time for all purposes to be u/art.227 of the Constitution of India",5
35,Phraseology used in exercise of original jurisdiction u/art.226 of the Constitution in S.2 of the Act cannot be given a restricted and constricted meaning because an order passed in a writ petition can tantamount to an order u/art.226 or 227 of the Constitution of India and it would depend upon the real nature of the order passed by the learned Single Judge,5
35,To elaborate; whether the learned Single Judge has exercised his jurisdiction u/art.226 or u/art.227 or both would depend upon various aspects and many a facet as has been emphasized in the afore quoted decisions of the apex Court,5
35,"The pleadings,as has been indicated hereinabove,also assume immense significance",5
35,As has been held in the case of Surya Devi Rai (supra) a writ of certiorari can be issued u/art.226 of the Constitution against an order of a Tribunal or an order passed by the sub ordinate court,5
35,"In quintessentiality,it cannot be put in a state jacket formula that any order of the learned judge that deals with an order arising from an inferior tribunal or the sub ordinate court is an order u/art.227 of the Constitution of India and not an order u/art.226 of the Constitution",5
35,"It would not be an over emphasis to state that an order in a writ petition can fit into the subtle contour of Arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution in a composite manner and they can coincide,co-exit,overlap imbricate",5
35,In this context it is apt to note that there may be cases where the learned single judge may feel disposed or inclined to issue a writ to do full and complete justice because it is to be borne in mind that Art.226 of the Constitutions is fundamentally a repository and reservoir of justice based on equity and good conscience,5
35,It will depend upon factual matrix of the case,5
35,"Thus,there is no manner of doubt that the orders and proceedings of a judicial court subordinate to the High Court are amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court u/art.226 of the Constitution",5
35,"Upon a review of decided cases and a survey of the occasions,wherein the High Courts have exercised jurisdiction to command a writ of certiorari or to exercise supervisory jurisdiction u/art.227 in the given facts and circumstances in a variety of cases,it seems that the distinction between the two jurisdictions stands almost obliterated in practice",5
35,"Probably,this is the reason why it has become customary with the lawyers labelling their petitions as one common u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution,though such practice has been deprecated in some judicial pronouncement",5
35,"Without entering into niceties and technicality of the subject,we venture to state the broad general difference between the two jurisdictions",5
35,"Firstly,the writ of certiorari is an exercise of its original jurisdiction by the High Court; exercise of supervisory jurisdiction is not an original jurisdiction and in this sense it is akin to appellate,revisional or corrective jurisdiction",5
35,"Secondly,in a writ of certiorari,the record of the proceedings having been certified and sent up by the inferior court or tribunal to the High Court,the High Court if inclined to exercise its jurisdiction,may simply annul or quash the proceedings and then do no more",5
35,"In exercise of supervisory jurisdiction,the High Court may not only quash or set aside the impugned proceedings,judgment or order but it may also make such directions as the facts and circumstances of the case may warrant,maybe,by way of guiding the inferior court or tribunal as to the manner in which it would now proceed further or afresh as commended to or guided by the High Court",5
35,"In appropriate cases the High Court,while exercising supervisory jurisdiction,may substitute such a decision of its own in place of the impugned decision,as the inferior court or tribunal should have made",5
35,"Lastly,the jurisdiction u/art.226 of the Constitution is capable of being exercised on a prayer made by or on behalf of the party aggrieved; the supervisory jurisdiction is capable of being exercised suo motu as well",5
35,"In view of what has been stated above,the High Court was not justified in holding that the Letters Patent Appeal was not maintainable",1
35,"In addition,a bare reading of this Court's earlier order shows that the impugned order is clearly erroneous",1

40,Certain acts not to be infringement of copyright.-(1,0
40,"The following acts shall not constitute an infringement of copyright,namely:- (a) a fair dealing with a literary,dramatic,musical or artistic work not being a computer programme for the purpose of-(i",0
40,"Private use including research; (ii) criticism or review,whether of that work or of any other work; xxx xxx xxx (i) the performance,in the course of the Activities of an educational institution,of a literary,dramatic or musical work by the staff and student of the institution,or of a cinematograph film or a sound recording,if the audience is limited to such staff and students,the parents and guardians of the students and persons directly connected with the Activities of the institution or the communication to such an audience of a cinematograph film or sound recording",0
40,l,0
40,"the performance of a literary,dramatic or musical work by an amateur club or society,if the performance is given to a non-paying audience,or for the benefit of a religious institution",0
40,"Before adverting to the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties,we may notice the issues framed in the suit,which are: ""(i) Does plaintiff prove that late Dr",1
40,"Shivaramaji Karanth had acquired copyright in respect of seven Yakshagana Prasangas and also in respect of Yakshagana dramatic or theatrical form i.e.,Bhishma",1
40,"Vijaya,Nala Damayanthi,Kanakaangti or Kanakangi Kalyana,Abhimanyu or Abhimanyu Vadha,Chitrangadha or Babruvahana Kalaga,Panchavati Chritha followed in the plaint",1
40,Has the plaintiff became entitled to the said right under the Registered Will dated 18.06.1994,1
40,Does the plaintiff prove that her right under the said Will was infringed by the defendants,1
40,"Indisputably,in view of the submissions made at the bar,respondent had acquired copyright in respect of seven Yakshagana Prasangas as also in respect of Yakshagana dramatic or theatrical form as a residuary legatee in terms of clause 12 of the Will dated 18.6.1994",3
40,"However,we may notice that whereas the trial court has proceeded on the basis that clause 12 of the Will shall apply in the instant case,the High Court opined that clause 11 thereof is attracted,stating: ""No doubt,by reading para-12 of the 'Will' in isolation,one can certainly arrive at the conclusion that the bequest made in favour of the plaintiff is in the nature of residuary bequest",3
40,"But,that is not all,in the 'Will'-Ex",3
40,"P-1.I have already referred to para No.11 of the 'Will' while dealing with the topic dramatic works vis-'-vis literary work and therefore if the 'Will' is read in its entirety and if we take into account,the benefits that flow from the bequest made by Dr",3
40,"Karanth in favour of the plaintiff,it is not as if the plaintiff received the bequest only in respect of the things which form the residuary as mentioned in para-12 of the 'Will' but the plaintiff also was given the copyrights in respect of literary works and all books as well as the right to print,republished and mark the literary works as well as the books",3
40,"Referring to the new Encyclopaedia Britannica and Halsbury's Laws of England,that a literary work with dramatic elements in it would also be literary work,the High Court observed: ""Dramatic works also could contain in its,passages of great literary taste,as in the case of great plays of William Shakespear",3
40,"Therefore,the main classification as literary work and dramatic work cannot be construed to mean that dramatic work has nothing to do with literary work",3
40,The only difference I see in them is that the dramatic work (Plays) forms the text upon which the performance of the plays rests whereas a 'literary work' enables one to read the printed words,3
40,Neither of the two can be produced without the imaginative skill of the author,3
40,"It was furthermore held: ""I am of the considered opinion that all the above changes brought about by Dr",3
40,Karanth in respect of Yakshagana Ballet leads to the inference that the imaginative faculties of Dr,3
40,Karanth permeated the entire Yakshagana Prasangas and thus a new look was given to the Yakshagana Ballets,3
40,"I,therefore,hold that the bequest of copyright in literary works and books in favour of the plaintiff by Dr",3
40,"Karanth,will have to be treated as the bequest covering the dramatic works also since I have also drawn the conclusion that the dramatic works is also a form of literature",3
40,"Therefore,necessity of mentioning copyright separately in respect of dramatic works does not arise",3
40,"The plaintiff,therefore,is entitled to copyright even in respect of the dramatic works namely the seven prasangas,by virtue of bequest made in her favour in respect of copyrights and books",3
40,"Broadly speaking,a dramatic work may also come within the purview of literary work being a part of dramatic literature",1
40,"The new Encyclopaedia Britannica (Vol-IV) 15th Edition,provides the following information about ""Dramatic Literature",1
40,"Dramatic Literature: the texts of plays that can be read,as distinct from being seen and heard in performance",1
40,"We must,however,notice that the provisions the Act make a distinction between the 'literary work' and 'dramatic work'.Keeping in view the statutory provisions,there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that copyright in respect of performance of 'dance' would not come within the purview of the literary work but would come within the purview of the definition of 'dramatic work'.We,however,do not mean to suggest that any act of literary work will be outside the purview of the Will dated 18.6.1994.Our exercise in this behalf was only for the purpose of clarifying the provisions of the Act with reference to the findings arrived at by the High Court",1
40,"For the aforementioned reasons,we agree with Dr",1
40,"Dhavan that paragraph 12 of the Will,namely,residuary clause shall apply in the instant case apart from the areas which are otherwise covered by paragraph 11 of the Will",1
40,The residuary clause will apply because it is well settled that no part of the stay lies in limbo,1
40,It was also not a case where respondent in any manner whatsoever waived her right,1
40,The learned trial judge on issue No.4 opined that plaintiff had not been able to prove actual loss or damage particularly having regard to the fact that Dr,6
40,Karanth had associated himself with the appellants for a long time,6
40,The learned trial judge recognized the equitable interest vested in the plaintiff -respondent,6
40,"A declaratory decree,therefore,was passed",6
40,We may notice at this stage that the form of injunction granted both by the learned trial judge as also by the High Court in favour of the plaintiff-respondent,3
40,"The operative part of the judgment of the trial court reads as under: ""Defendants or their employees or agents are restrained from performing the above said 7 ballets or Prasangas or in parts thereof in any manner as evolved distinctively by Dr",3
40,Karanth by way of permanent injunction,3
40,"The High Court,however,directed: ""(iii",3
40,"As far as the restraint order passed by the Trial Court by granting permanent injunction to the plaintiff is concerned,the same is modified by ordering that if the appellants desire to stage any of the seven Yakshagana prasangas in the manner and form as conceived in all respects viz.,costumes,choreography and direction by Dr",3
40,"Karanth,the appellants can do so only in accordance with the provisions of the Copyrights Act,1957 in view of copyright in seven prasangas vesting with the plaintiff",3
40,Decree for injunction is an equitable relief,1
40,The courts while passing a decree for permanent injunction would avoid multiplicity of proceedings,1
40,"The court while passing such a decree,is obligated to consider the statutory provisions governing the same",1
40,"For the said purpose,it must be noticed as to what is a copyright and in respect of the matters the same cannot be claimed or otherwise the same is lodged by conditions and subject to statutory limitation",1
40,In R.G.Anand vs,5
40,M/s,5
40,Delux Films & ors.[(1978,5
40,"4 SCC 118]1978 Indlaw SC 294,this Court held: ""Thus,on a careful consideration and elucidation of the various authorities and the case law on the subject discussed above,the following propositions emerge: 1.There can be no copyright in an idea,subject-matter,themes,plots or historical or legendary facts and violation of the copyright in such cases is confined to the form,manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the author of the copyrighted work",5
40,"2.Where the same idea is being developed in a different manner,it is manifest that the source being common,similarities are bound to occur",5
40,In such a case the courts should determine whether or not the similarities are on fundamental or substantial aspects of the mode of expression adopted in the copyrighted work,5
40,If the defendant's work is nothing but a literal imitation of the copyrighted work with some variations here and there it would amount to violation of the copyright,5
40,"In other words,in order to be actionable the copy must be a substantial and material one which at once leads to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy",5
40,"3.One of the surest and the safest test to determine whether or not there has been a violation of copyright is to see if the reader,spectator or the viewer after having read or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original",5
40,"4.Where the theme is the same but is presented and treated differently so that the subsequent work becomes a completely new work,no question of violation of copyright arises",5
40,5.Where however apart from the similarities appearing in the two works there are also material and broad dissimilarities which negative the intention to copy the original and the coincidences appearing in the two works are clearly incidental,5
40,no infringement of the copyright comes into existence,5
40,6.As,5
40,a violation of copyright amounts to an act of piracy it must be proved by clear and cogent evidence after applying the various tests laid down by the case-law discussed above,5
40,7.Where,5
40,however the question is of the violation of the copyright of stage play by a film producer or a director the task of the plaintiff becomes more difficult to prove piracy,5
40,"It is manifest that unlike a stage play a film has a much broader prospective,wider field and a bigger background where the defendants can by introducing a variety of incidents give a colour and complexion different from the manner in which the copyrighted work has expressed the idea",5
40,"Even so,if the viewer after seeing the film gets a totality of impression that the film is by and large a copy of the original play,violation of the copyright may be said to be proved",5
40,Yet again in Eastern Book Company & ors vs,5
40,D.B.Modak & Anr.[(2008,5
40,"1 SCC 1]2007 Indlaw SC 1341,this Court held: ""The Copyright Act is not concerned with the original idea but with the expression of thought",5
40,Copyright has nothing to do with originality or literary merit,5
40,"Copyrighted material is that what is created by the author by his own skill,labour and investment of capital,maybe it is a derivative work which gives a flavour of creativity",5
40,"The copyright work which comes into being should be original in the sense that by virtue of selection,coordination or arrangement of pre-existing data contained in the work,a work somewhat different in character is produced by the author",5
40,"On the face of the provisions of the Copyright Act,1957,we think that the principle laid down by the Canadian Court would be applicable in copyright of the judgments of the Apex Court",5
40,We make it clear that the decision of ours would be confined to the judgments of the courts which are in the public domain as by virtue of Section 52 of the Act there is no copyright in the original text of the judgments,5
40,"To claim copyright in a compilation,the author must produce the material with exercise of his skill and judgment which may not be creativity in the sense that it is novel or non-obvious,but at the same time it is not a product of merely labour and capital",5
40,The derivative work produced by the author must have some distinguishable features and flavour to raw text of the judgments delivered by the court,5
40,The trivial variation or inputs put in the judgment would not satisfy the test of copyright of an author,5
40,"The High Court,in our opinion,should have clarified that the appellants can also take the statutory benefit of the provisions contained in clauses (a),(i) and (l) of sub-section (1) of Section 52 of the Act",1
40,Section 52 of the Act provides for certain acts which would not constitute an infringement of copyright,1
40,"When a fair dealing is made,inter alia,of a literary or dramatic work for the purpose of private use including research and criticism or review,whether of that work or of any other work,the right in terms of the provisions of the said Act cannot be claimed",1
40,"Thus,if some performance or dance is carried out within the purview of the said clause,the order of injunction shall not be applicable",1
40,"Similarly,appellant being an educational institution,if the dance is performed within the meaning of provisions of clause (i) of sub-section (1) of Section 52 of the Act strictly,the order of injunction shall not apply thereto also",1
40,"Yet again,if such performance is conducted before a non-paying audience by the appellant,which is an institution if it comes within the purview of amateur club or society,the same would not constitute any violation of the said order of injunction",1
40,"With the aforementioned modification in the order of injunction,this appeal is dismissed",4
40,"However,in the facts and circumstances of the case,there shall be no order as to costs",4
40,Appeal dismissed,4
41,The present appeal arises out of the judgment and order dated 01.07.2002 passed by the High Court of Bombay at Goa in Criminal Appeal No. 6 of 2000 convicting the accused-appellant u/s,6
41,302 of the Indian Penal Code (for short the 'the IPC') and sentencing him to undergo life imprisonment for the offence by setting aside the order of acquittal passed by the trial court,6
41,Facts giving rise to the present appeal may be stated first so as to enable us to appreciate the arguments raised by the parties more effectively,1
41,"On 19.04.1988 between 8.30 p.m. and 8.45 p.m., Satish Narayan Sawant, the appellant (Accused No. 1) along with two other accused persons and also with two delinquent children allegedly formed an unlawful assembly and that in furtherance of the said common object stabbed one Rauji Dulba Sawant, the deceased and also assaulted Baby Dulba Sawant (PW-1), Ashok Dulba Sawant (PW-2), Kunda Rauji Sawant (PW-8) and Laxmi Dulba Sawant (PW-18) who are the sister, brother, wife and mother respectively of the deceased",6
41,"It is also the case of the prosecution that as a result of the aforesaid stab injuries given to the deceased, he expired on the same day i.e. on 19.04.1988",6
41,"P.S. Joaquim Dias (PW-21) who was attached to the Ponda Police Station as P.S.I. received a phone call at about 10.45 p.m. from P.S.I. K.K. Desai of the Panaji Police Station that a person named Rauji Dulba Sawant had been brought in police jeep by police constable Jaisingrao Rane and that while he was being taken to the Goa Medical College, he expired",6
41,"He was informed that the deceased had died as a result of stab injuries received and, therefore, he was to take necessary steps",6
41,"On receipt of the aforesaid message, PW-21 along with ASI Tabit Mamlekar went to the scene of offence",6
41,"They reached the scene of offence at about 11.30 p.m. but found the entire place plunged into darkness and with the help of torch light, PW-21 surveyed the scene of offence",6
41,"During the survey made at the place of occurrence, PW-21 noticed some blood-stains in the front courtyard of the house and a pipe of length of about 1 foot or slightly less lying in the courtyard having blood-stains",6
41,"Thereafter, PW-21, along with P.I. D'Sa gave a call to the inmates of the house to open the door and on hearing the call, one lady opened the door",6
41,"On enquiring from her, PW- 21 learnt that her name was 'Yeshoda' who was later on arrayed as Accused No. 3",6
41,"Two juvenile girls named, Sarita and Sharmila, who are the sisters of the appellant were found in the house",6
41,"In the meantime, PW-1, PW-2 and PW-8 came to the house from whom PW-21 made certain inquiries and brought them along with Accused No. 3 and her two juvenile girls to the Police Station",6
41,"Not finding the appellant and accused no.2 in the house, Dy",6
41,S.P. Shri Raikar and P.I,6
41,Shri Alan O'Sa were sent in their search,6
41,"After reaching the police station, a complaint, which is marked as Exhibit PW 1/A was lodged by PW-1, in which it was alleged that PW-1, PW-8, PW-18, the deceased Rauji and his brother Narayan were residing in one house in Banastari and they used to share a common kitchen between them",6
41,"It was further alleged by PW-1 that two or three days before the Ganesh Festival, deceased Rauji had informed Narayan that he would install statue of Lord Ganesh in the house and accordingly, he had purchased the same",6
41,Religious ceremony was performed by installing the statue of Lord Ganesh in the house and,6
41,"while the said religious ceremony was being performed, Accused No. 2 started uttering insults while standing in the kitchen",6
41,Accused No. 3 told the appellant not to do anything in the ceremony and insulted the family members of Rauji,6
41,PW-1 also alleged that on 19.04.1988 the deceased Rauji returned from his duty at about 6.30 p.m. and thereafter went to purchase some articles,6
41,"On his return, he went to take bath and after having bath, he went and switched off the light of the room",6
41,"As soon as the deceased switched off the light, the appellant came from the room and started abusing Rauji",6
41,"There was a heated exchange of words between Rauji and the appellant switched on the light, which was again switched off by Rauji, the deceased",6
41,"Thereupon, the appellant went and removed the fuse of the said light",6
41,Accused No. 3 had then lit a kerosene lamp and brought the same in the hall,6
41,There was already an oil lamp burning which was attached to the ceiling by a brass chain,6
41,"Meanwhile, Accused No. 3 started abusing PW-1, PW-8, PW-18, and the deceased Rauji",6
41,"Thereafter, the appellant and the two other alleged accused namely, Accused Nos",6
41,"2 and 3 and the two juvenile offenders gathered in the hall to assault Rauji, the deceased, PW-1 and PW-8",6
41,"According to PW-1, in order to avoid the assault by all of them, they went to ""bulcao"" (balcony",6
41,"When they went there, the appellant went to his mother's room and brought a knife with which he stabbed Rauji",6
41,At that time all the accused persons were in the balcony,6
41,"It was also alleged that after the deceased Rauji fell down on the ground, Accused No. 3 kicked him",6
41,"At that time, the appellant who was holding the knife in his hand, handed over the same to Accused No. 3 by which she assaulted PW-8 but PW-8 caught the knife in her hand which caused injury to her right palm",6
41,"Thereafter, according to PW-1, Accused No. 3 handed back the knife to the appellant and Accused No. 2 brought the oil lamp which was hung in the room and hit the oil lamp on the head of Rauji, the deceased",6
41,"It was also alleged that when PW-8 tried to intervene, the other three accused started assaulting her with fists and slaps",6
41,"At that time, PW-2 came there and questioned the accused persons as to what they were doing, whereupon, the appellant and Accused no. 2 started assaulting PW-2 also",6
41,"Then, Accused No. 3 told the appellant and Accused No. 2 to finish off Rauji first. PW-8, PW-18 and PW-1 then lifted Rauji and brought him in the courtyard",6
41,"In the meanwhile, residents of the locality had gathered in the courtyard and told the accused persons not to assault Rauji",6
41,"The juvenile offender, Sarita went inside the house and brought out one iron pipe which she handed over to the appellant who then hit the said pipe on the right leg of PW-1 and also gave a blow with the said pipe on Rauji's right hand",6
41,"It was also alleged that the other juvenile offender, Sharmila brought a cement block shaped like an elephant trunk, which she handed over to Accused No. 3 with which Accused No. 3 started assaulting Rauji. PW-1, however, intervened and removed the said piece of cement block from the hand of Accused No. 3 but",6
41,Accused No. 3 then picked up one stone and tried to throw it on Rauji by saying that she was going to kill him with that stone,6
41,"However, PW-1 again intervened and removed the said stone from the hand of Accused No.3",6
41,PW- 18 rushed to the rescue of deceased Rauji,6
41,The accused then started assaulting her and PW-8 with slaps,6
41,"In the meantime, police jeep arrived at the scene and on seeing the police jeep, all the accused ran away from the courtyard and went inside",6
41,PW - 1 and others asked the police to take Rauji to the Hospital,6
41,"whereupon the police took him to the hospital in the police jeep along with PW-1, PW - 2 and PW -8",6
41,"On the basis of complaint made by PW-1, an FIR was registered and the accused came to be arrested",6
41,"On completion of the investigation, the police submitted the charge- sheet against the accused persons namely the present appellant (Accused No. 1), Accused Nos",6
41,"2 and 3 and the two juvenile offenders, namely Sarita and Sharmila",6
41,"The trial court framed charges against all the accused persons for the offence under Sections 302, 323, 143, 147 and 149 of the IPC",6
41,The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried,6
41,Since there were two juvenile offenders there cases were segregated and the trial against Accused Nos,6
41,"1, 2 and 3 was conducted during the course of which a number of eye-witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution",6
41,After completion of the arguments the trial court reserved the verdict,6
41,"The trial court passed an order on 04.08.1998 acquitting all the accused persons from the offences under Sections 302, 323, 143, 147 and 149 of IPC",6
41,Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order of acquittal the State filed an appeal in the High Court against Accused Nos,6
41,1 to 3,6
41,The High Court by impugned judgment convicted appellant,3
41,Accused No. 1) u/s,3
41,302 IPC and Accused Nos,3
41,2 and 3 were held guilty of an offence punishable u/s,3
41,323 read with S. 34 of the IPC,3
41,"The appellant herein, being aggrieved by the aforesaid order of conviction and sentence, filed the present appeal on which we have heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant and also the learned counsel appearing for the State",6
41,"Mr. R. Sundaravardhan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant very forcefully submitted that the High Court was not justified in setting aside the order of acquittal passed in respect of the present appellant",2
41,He submitted that although the incident in question had taken place at about 8.45 p.m. the same came to be reported to the police at 3.00 a.m,2
41,"He also submitted that the police officer (PW-21) who received the information about the incident started investigation without recording either any general diary (for short G.D.) entry or the FIR and, therefore, the FIR which has been proved in the trial court is hit by the provisions of S. 162 of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short ""the CrPC",2
41,He also submitted that the High Court has not given any reason for setting aside the appeal against acquittal which was passed after appreciating the entire evidence on record,2
41,He further submitted that there was not only shifting of time of the alleged occurrence but also shifting of the place of occurrence from the hall to the outside verandah and courtyard to suit the convenience of the prosecution case,2
41,He has drawn our attention towards the entire evidence on record including the cross-examination part and with the help of the same he submitted that the entire alleged incident in question had taken place when there was complete darkness at the scene of occurrence,2
41,"A scuffle started between the nephew and the uncle in which the accused persons also received injuries and, therefore, the right of private defence of the appellant was available and in that view of the matter, the order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside",2
41,It was further submitted that the alleged eye-witnesses of the occurrence were examined by the police belatedly and that the medical evidence adduced in the case does not in any manner support the ocular evidence and if at all it would not be a case of culpable homicide amounting to murder but a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder,2
41,"He also submitted that if two views are possible and if there are lacunae in the case of the prosecution, the benefit must go to the accused",2
41,He next submitted that there was no evidence on record as to when the FIR reached the Magistrate and that none of the courts below considered the said aspect,2
41,"He submitted that since there was violation of the provisions of S. 162 of the CrPC, the accused-appellant is liable to be acquitted",2
41,"Ms. A. Subhashini, learned counsel appearing for the respondent- State, however, strenuously submitted that none of the aforesaid submissions could be accepted by this Court as it is a foolproof case of conviction of the appellant u/s",2
41,302 IPC,1
41,She submitted that the High Court rightly interfered with the order of acquittal passed by the trial court after critically examining the evidence on record,2
41,It was submitted by her that the trial court examined the evidence in the present case in a very summary and cryptic manner and thereby arrived at a wrong conclusion that the accused persons were required to be acquitted,2
41,She has drawn our attention to the findings recorded by the High Court while setting aside the order of acquittal observing that the evidence of eye-witnesses namely PWs,2
41,"1, 2, 8 and 18 is convincing and reliable but so far as the evidence of PW-4 is concerned, the High Court has made an observation that he is not a reliable witness",2
41,"Counsel for the respondent has, therefore, taken us through the evidence of PWs",2
41,"1, 2, 8 and 18 and on the basis thereof submitted that their evidence clearly prove and establish the role of the appellant herein in stabbing the deceased with the knife which he had brought from the other room with the intention of killing the deceased and, therefore, it is a clear case of conviction",2
41,u/s,2
41,In the light of the aforesaid submissions of the counsel appearing for the parties we have given our in-depth consideration to the facts of the present case,1
41,The starting point of the incident in question as indicated from the evidence on record is the hall where apparently a dispute started between the parties with regard to the electricity connection in the house,1
41,The deceased tried to put off the light of one particular room at which the appellant and other accused persons became annoyed and the appellant switched on the light which was again switched off by the deceased,1
41,"At this, the deceased became annoyed and the appellant removed the fuse of the electricity which act of his plunged the entire house into darkness",1
41,It is also clear and established that thereafter a lamp was brought by Accused No. 3 to the room besides another lamp which was already burning in the said room itself,1
41,"But, in any case, there was an electricity light post in the front of the house which was giving enough light to the house",1
41,There is also evidence on record to show that even outsiders were watching the incident from the road which indicates that there was sufficient light for them to see what was happening in the house where the incident had taken place,1
41,There was indeed some scuffle between the parties during the course of which Accused No. 1 received simple injuries and the deceased died of the two stab injuries inflicted by the present appellant,1
41,The said fact is proved by the evidence of PWs,1
41,"2, 8, 18 and the complainant herself (PW-1",1
41,The deceased was taken to the hospital and while so taken he died,1
41,PW-21 who was at that time attached to Konda Police Station as PSI was informed at about 10.45 p.m. that the deceased while was being brought in the police jeep by a police constable Jaisingrao Rane and was being taken to the Government Medical College but before the deceased could be admitted he died,1
41,"PW-21 was also informed by said by said PSI K.K. Desai of Panaji Police Station that it was a case of assault and that the incident had taken place at verandah and that the said matter pertains to his police station and, therefore, he should take appropriate action",1
41,On receiving the said message he went to the place of occurrence along with PSI K.K. Desai and upon reaching the place of occurrence at 11.30 p.m. he found the entire place plunged in total darkness,1
41,"Therefore, he proceeded to survey the place of occurrence with the help of torches",1
41,"He, in his deposition specifically stated that he found that the back door as well as the front door of the house were latched from inside and in front of the house there was a road where there was an electricity pole and there was a street tube light by which the house could be visible and even the lights of the vehicles were flashed at the house",1
41,"He stated that although the house had electricity connection, but was not having the electricity supply",1
41,He gave instructions to his subordinate and also to the people around that nobody should touch any article lying at the scene of occurrence,1
41,He stated that he made preliminary enquiry and brought Yashoda and her two daughters to the police station and sent two other officers in search of Accused Nos,1
41,1 and 2 who were not found in the house,1
41,He also stated that he got the complaint registered at the police station which was lodged by PW-1 and that on the next day he again went to the scene of offence and seized the properties involved in the crime which were sealed,1
41,He also recovered the knife at the instance of accused Sharmila which he seized,1
41,"On 28.04.1988, that is, after about 9 days of the incident, Accused Nos",1
41,1 and 2 surrendered before the police and on their surrender they were taken into custody,1
41,It was found that Accused No. 1 was having injury on his back,1
41,and he was medically examined,1
41,On medical examination his injury was found to be simple,1
41,Learned counsel appearing for the appellant was critical of the manner in which PW-21 initiated the investigation without recording any G.D. entry and without getting any FIR recorded,2
41,"He submitted that since the investigation in the instant case was started by the police without recording an FIR, such an FIR is necessarily hit by the provisions of S. 162 of the Cr",2
41,P.C,2
41,"He next submitted that no evidence having been led by the prosecution about the time when the FIR reached the Magistrate, therefore, there is also violation of the provisions of S. 157 of the Cr",2
41,"The issue with regard to the initiation of the investigation without recording the FIR was succinctly addressed by this Court in the case of State of U.P. v. Bhagwant Kishore Joshi, (1964) 3 SCR 71 1963 Indlaw SC 268, observed as follows: ""17",5
41,"What is investigation is not defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure; but in H.N. Rishbud and Inder Singh v. State of Delhi 1954 Indlaw SC 14 this Court has described, the procedure, for investigation as follows: ""Thus, under the Code investigation consists generally of the following steps, (1) Proceeding to the spot, (2) Ascertainment of the facts and circumstances of the case, (3) Discovery and arrest of the suspected offender, (4) Collection of evidence relating to the commission of the offence which may consist of (a) the examination of various persons (including the accused) and the reduction of their statements into writing, if the officer thinks fit, (b) the search of places of seizure of things considered necessary for the investigation and to be produced at the trial, and (5) formation of the opinion as to whether on the material collected there is a case to place the accused before a Magistrate for trial and if so taking the necessary steps for the same by the filing of a charge-sheet u/s",5
41,"This Court, however, has not said that if a police officer takes merely one or two of the steps indicated by it, what he has done must necessarily be regarded as investigation",5
41,"Investigation, in substance, means collection of evidence relating to the commission of the offence",5
41,"The Investigating Officer is, for this purpose, entitled to question persons who, in this opinion, are able to throw light on the offence which has been committed and is likewise entitled to question the suspect and is entitled to reduce the statements of persons questioned by him to writing",5
41,He is also entitled to search the place of the offence and to search other places with the object of seizing articles connected with the offence,5
41,"No doubt, for this purpose he has to proceed to the spot where the offence was committed and do various other things",5
41,"But the main object of investigation being to bring home the offence to the offender the essential part of the duties of an investigating officer in this connection is, apart from arresting the offender, to collect all material necessary for establishing the accusation against the offender",5
41,Merely making some preliminary enquire upon receipt of information from an anonymous source or a source of doubtful reliability for checking up the correctness of the information does not amount to collection of evidence and so cannot be regarded as investigation,5
41,"In the absence of any prohibition in the Code, express or implied, I am of opinion that it is open to a police officer to make preliminary enquiries before registering an offence and making a full scale investigation into it",5
41,"No doubt, Section 5-A of the Prevention of Corruption Act was enacted for preventing harassment to a government servant and with this object in view investigation, except with the previous permission of a Magistrate, is not permitted to be made by an officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police",5
41,"Where, however, a police officer makes some preliminary enquiries, does not arrest or even question an accused or question any witnesses but merely makes a few discreet enquiries or looks at some documents without making any notes, it is difficult to visualise how any possible harassment or even embarrassment would result therefrom to the suspect or the accused person",5
41,If no harassment to the accused results from the action of a police officer how can it be said to defeat the purpose underlying Section 5-A,5
41,"Looking at the matter this way, I hold that what Mathur did was something very much short of investigation and, therefore, the provisions of Section 5-A were not violated",5
41,Since no irregularity was committed by him there is no occasion to invoke the aid of the curative provisions of the Code,5
41,emphasis underlined,5
41,"In the instant case, it is quite clear from the evidence on record that PW-1 received the information about the death of the deceased from PSI of Panaji Police Station without any detail as to how the incident had happened and who had caused the incident",1
41,"It was a very cryptic information received by him regarding the death of a person residing within the jurisdiction of his police station pursuant to an incident taking place on 10.04.1988 between 8.30 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. and, therefore, it appears that there was not enough information available to him either to get a G.D. entry recorded or to get an FIR lodged",1
41,"In order to verify the information received, PW-21 went to the place of occurrence and found the entire house in total darkness",1
41,He went around the house and saw blood marks on the walls of the verandah and also in the courtyard and came to learn about the incident by using torch light,1
41,When he reached at the place of occurrence even the complainant party was not available there,1
41,but at a later stage they came there,1
41,"Therefore, he brought them along with the residents of the house who were found to be there namely Accused No. 3 and the two juvenile offenders namely Sarita and Sharmila, who were all ladies",1
41,After reaching the police station and at the request of PW-1 the FIR was recorded at 3.00 a.m. in the morning,1
41,He received the information about the incident on telephone at about 10.45 p.m. and reached the place of occurrence at about 11.30 p.m. and he must have been there for quite some time and thereafter returned to the police station which must have taken another about 1.30 to 2 hours,1
41,"Therefore, recording of the FIR at about 3.00 a.m. in the morning was justified and properly explained and it cannot be said that there was any delay in recording the FIR",1
41,"Besides, the fact of his going to the place of occurrence would not amount to making an investigation",1
41,"There is no evidence to show that at that point of time, PW-21 seized any articles or interrogated any witnesses or took any other action in initiating or in furtherance of investigation",1
41,The ratio of the decision in Bhagwant Kishore Joshi 1963 Indlaw SC 268 (supra) is applicable to the facts of the present case as the police officer merely visited the spot and place of occurrence and made some survey which cannot be regarded as investigation,1
41,"In Animireddy Venkata Ramana and Others v. Public Prosecutor, High Court of Andhra Pradesh, (2008) 5 SCC 368, 2008 Indlaw SC 354 , this Court while considering a similar case observed as follows: "" 10",5
41,Certain basic facts are not denied or disputed,5
41,The deceased died in the bus at about 10.30 p.m. on 23-6-1998 while travelling to his village home from Tuni,5
41,PW 1 also sustained injuries in the said incident,5
41,"Immediately after the incident, hearing cries of passengers, the driver of the bus stopped the bus",5
41,"Not only the accused persons fled away, all others also did, including PWs 3 and 4",5
41,They came back after a short while hearing the cries of PW 1,5
41,They acceded to his request to take the bus to his house,5
41,"From the records, it appears that the distance between the place where the accident took place and the village in question was not much",5
41,"In any event, the destination of the bus was the said village and they were bound to take the bus thereat",5
41,"PW 1 informed about the incident to PW 2, another son of the deceased",5
41,The dead body of the deceased was brought down from the bus and taken to the house,5
41,The conductor of the bus sent an information to the Depot Manager of the State Road Transport Corporation at Tuni,5
41,The investigating officer was also informed,5
41,A report to that effect might have been noted in the general diary but the same could not have been treated to be an FIR,5
41,"When an information is received by an officer in charge of a police station, he in terms of the provisions of the Code was expected to reach the place of occurrence as early as possible",5
41,It was not necessary for him to take that step only on the basis of a first information report,5
41,An information received in regard to commission of a cognizable offence is not required to be preceded by a first information report,5
41,Duty of the State to protect the life of an injured as also an endeavour on the part of the responsible police officer to reach the place of occurrence in a situation of this nature is his implicit duty and responsibility,5
41,"If some incident had taken place in a bus, the officers of Road Transport Corporation also could not ignore the same",5
41,They reached the place of occurrence in another bus at about 1 a.m,5
41,The deceased and the injured were only then shifted to Tuni Hospital,5
41,The ratio of the aforesaid decision is squarely applicable to the facts of the present case,1
41,"Even assuming that PW-21, the Investigating Officer could have entered the aforesaid information received from PSI of Panaji Police Station in the general diary, yet they said entry could not have been held or treated to be an FIR",1
41,"The information received by him was very cryptic and without any detail about the incident in question and, therefore, in any case, there was no possibility of recording an FIR at that stage",1
41,"The place of occurrence was in total darkness and even the persons belonging to the complainant side were not available, therefore, bringing them to the police station where there was sufficient light and recording the complaint at 3.00 a.m. cannot, in any manner, cast any doubt on the veracity of the prosecution case",1
41,In that view of the matter it cannot be said that the FIR was in any manner hit by the provisions of S. 162 of CrPC,1
41,"So far contention that there was violation of S. 157 of the CrPC is concerned, the same is also without any basis for the defence never cross-examined PW-21 on the aforesaid issue",1
41,"So long the defence is not able to establish from the records by cogent evidence that there was any delay in sending the FIR to the Magistrate, it cannot be held that there was any such delay",1
41,There is no evidence on record before us to hold either way for no such issue was raised either before the trial court or before the High Court nor any evidence was led by the defence in respect of the said issue which is sought to be raised at this stage,1
41,"From the evidence on record it does not appear to us that any suggestion was given to the said witness to the effect that the copy of the FIR was not sent or that it was dispatched late, which if given, would have given an opportunity to the witness to afford some explanation or to show as to when the FIR, was sent to and received by the Magistrate",1
41,In that view of the matter we do not agree with the counsel appearing for the appellant that delay in transmitting the FIR to the Magistrate stands proved in the present case,1
41,The next contention that we proceed to discuss now is about whether sufficient light was available at the place of occurrence for the eye- witnesses to see the occurrence as stated by them in the evidence,1
41,We have PWs,1
41,"1, 2, 8 and 18 as eye-witnesses to the occurrence",1
41,These eye-witnesses have stated that the incident had happened initially in the hall where there was some light for Accused No. 3 has brought a lamp to the hall and apart from that another lamp was also burning which was attached to the ceiling,1
41,Blood was found by the police on the wall of the verandah and in the courtyard,1
41,It is also established from the evidence on record for it is clearly stated that the street light having tube light was giving sufficient light to the place of occurrence and that it was directed towards the house which was the place of occurrence,1
41,"Besides, all the aforesaid eye-witnesses were inmates of the house and they would know as to who had given the blows for they specifically stated that initially the appellant did not have the knife in his hand but when the deceased and others went to the balcony then he went inside the house and brought a knife with which he gave stab injuries to the deceased which became fatal and as a result of which the deceased died while he was being taken to the hospital",1
41,"The aforesaid eye-witnesses, although, are related witnesses, were natural witnesses for they were the inmates of the house where the incident had taken place",1
41,The said eye-witnesses are consistent about the principal act of the appellant in stabbing the deceased,1
41,"The discrepancies which were sought to be pointed out are minor discrepancies without in any manner affecting the substratum of the prosecution case and therefore, minor discrepancies in the evidence of the eye-witnesses are immaterial",1
41,"This Court has observed as follows in the case of Dinesh Kumar v. State of Rajasthan, (2008) 8 SCC 270 2008 Indlaw SC 2034, : ""11",5
41,It is to be noted that PWs 7 and 13 were the injured witnesses and PW 10 was another eyewitness and was the informant,5
41,"Law is fairly well settled that even if acquittal is recorded in respect of the co-accused on the ground that there were exaggerations and embellishments, yet conviction can be recorded if the evidence is found cogent, credible and truthful in respect of another accused",5
41,The mere fact that the witnesses were related to the deceased cannot be a ground to discard their evidence,5
41,"In law, testimony of an injured witness is given importance",5
41,"When the eyewitnesses are stated to be interested and inimically disposed towards the accused, it has to be noted that it would not be proper to conclude that they would shield the real culprit and rope in innocent persons",5
41,The truth or otherwise of the evidence has to be weighed pragmatically,5
41,The court would be required to analyse the evidence of related witnesses and those witnesses who are inimically disposed towards the accused,5
41,"But if after careful analysis and scrutiny of their evidence, the version given by the witnesses appears to be clear, cogent and credible, there is no reason to discard the same",5
41,Conviction can be made on the basis of such evidence,5
41,The aforesaid eye-witnesses were cross-examined at length but even after such lengthy cross-examination these eye-witnesses account could not be shaken,1
41,"The postmortem report indicates that there were sixteen injuries as against the two as adduced in ocular evidence and, therefore, a submission was made by the counsel appearing for the appellant that the medical evidence adduced in the present case is not supporting the ocular evidence",1
41,"However, a perusal of record clearly shows that the doctor who conducted the postmortem (PW-7) stated in his evidence that there were in total 16 injuries when external examination was done by him and the knife M. O. 11 could have caused the injuries no. 1, 2, 3 and 4",1
41,He further stated that the death was caused due to hemorrhage and shock as a result of stab injury,1
41,He further stated that Injury No. 1 was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature,1
41,"On being cross-examined, PW-7 categorically stated that death due to stab injury was in consequence of Injury No. 1 and all other injuries were superficial in nature",1
41,There is no doubt that four injuries are indicated in the postmortem report shown to have been received by the deceased but the fact that the deceased was given stab injuries by the appellant with the help of a knife brought by him from inside the house is clearly established from the ocular evidence,1
41,"There is therefore one particular injury, being injury No. 1 caused because of stabbing and the rest being superficial in nature could be caused during scuffle",1
41,"Therefore, the alleged discrepancy cannot be said to be very vital as it has been held by this Court in several decisions that ocular evidence cannot be brushed aside only because, to some extent, it is not in consonance with the medical evidence",1
41,"Reference in this regard may be made to the decision of this Court in State of U. P. v. Krishna Gopal, (1988) 4 SCC 302; 1988 Indlaw SC 76 Anwar v. State of Haryana, (1997) 9 SCC 766; 1997 Indlaw SC 2447 Ravi Kumar v. State of Punjab, (2005) 9 SCC 315 2005 Indlaw SC 170; Munivel v. State of T.N., (2006) 9 SCC 394 2006 Indlaw SC 118",1
41,All the contentions raised by learned counsel appearing for the appellant were considered by us in the light of evidence on record,1
41,and we find that none of the aforesaid submissions has any basis,1
41,There is cogent and reliable evidence on record to prove and establish that the accused has committed the act of stabbing as a result of which the deceased had died,1
41,Before dwelling further into the factual matrix of the case on the basis of which the High Court convicted the appellant u/s,1
41,302 IPC; it would be useful to briefly recapitulate the law on the point,1
41,S. 299 and S. 300 IPC deals with the definition of culpable homicide and murder respectively,0
41,S. 299 defines culpable homicide as the act of causing death; (i) with the intention of causing death or (ii) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death or (iii) with the knowledge that such act is likely to cause death,0
41,The bare reading of the section makes it crystal clear that the first and the second clause of the section refer to intention apart from the knowledge and the third clause refers to knowledge alone and not intention,0
41,"Both the expression ""intent"" and ""knowledge"" postulate the existence of a positive mental attitude which is of different degrees",0
41,The mental element in culpable homicide i.e. mental attitude towards the consequences of conduct is one of intention and knowledge,0
41,"If that is caused in any of the aforesaid three circumstances, the offence of culpable homicide is said to have been committed",0
41,"S. 300 IPC, however, deals with murder although there is no clear definition of murder provided in S. 300 IPC",0
41,It has been repeatedly held by this Court that culpable homicide is the genus and murder is species and that all murders are culpable homicide but not vice versa,0
41,S. 300 IPC further provides for the exceptions which will constitute culpable homicide not amounting to murder and punishable u/s,0
41,When and if there is intent and knowledge then the same would be a case of S. 304,0
41,Part,0
41,"I and if it is only a case of knowledge and not the intention to cause murder and bodily injury, then the same would be a case of S. 304 Part II",0
41,The aforesaid distinction between an act amounting to murder and an act not amounting to murder has been brought out in the numerous decisions of this Court,0
41,"In the case of State of A.P. v. Rayavarapu Punnayya, (1976) 4 SCC 382, 1976 Indlaw SC 192 this Court observed as follows at page 386: ""12",5
41,"In the scheme of the Penal Code, ""culpable homicides"" is genus and ""murder"" its specie",5
41,"All ""murder"" is ""culpable homicide"" but not vice-versa",5
41,"Speaking generally, ""culpable homicide"" sans ""special characteristics of murder"", is ""culpable homicide not amounting to murder",5
41,"For the purpose of fixing punishment, proportionate to the gravity of this generic offence, the Code practically recognises three degrees of culpable homicide",5
41,"The first is, what may be called, ""culpable homicide of the first degree",5
41,"This is the greatest form of culpable homicide, which is defined in S. 300 as ""murder",5
41,"The second may be termed as ""culpable homicide of the second degree",5
41,This is punishable under the first part of S. 304,5
41,"Then, there is ""culpable homicide of the third degree",5
41,"This is the lowest type of culpable homicide and the punishment provided for it is, also, the lowest among the punishments provided for the three grades",5
41,Culpable homicide of this degree is punishable under the second part of S. 304,5
41,"Placing strong reliance on the aforesaid decision, this Court in the case of Abdul Waheed Khan v. State of A.P., (2002) 7 SCC 175 2002 Indlaw SC 1777, observed as follows at page 184: ""13",5
41,Cl,5
41,b) of S. 299 corresponds with cls,5
41,2) and (3) of S. 300,5
41,The distinguishing feature of the mens rea requisite u/cl,5
41,"2) is the knowledge possessed by the offender regarding the particular victim being in such a peculiar condition or state of health that the internal harm caused to him is likely to be fatal, notwithstanding the fact that such harm would not in the ordinary way of nature be sufficient to cause death of a person in normal health or condition",5
41,"It is noteworthy that the ""intention to cause death"" is not an essential requirement of cl",5
41,"Only the intention of causing the bodily injury coupled with the offender's knowledge of the likelihood of such injury causing the death of the particular victim, is sufficient to bring the killing within the ambit of this clause",5
41,This aspect of cl,5
41,2) is borne out by Illustration (b) appended to S. 300,5
41,b) of S. 299 does not postulate any such knowledge on the part of the offender,5
41,Instances of cases falling u/cl,5
41,"2) of S. 300 can be where the assailant causes death by a fist-blow intentionally given knowing that the victim is suffering from an enlarged liver, or enlarged spleen or diseased heart and such blow is likely to cause death of that particular person as a result of the rupture of the liver, or spleen or the failure of the heart, as the case may be",5
41,"If the assailant had no such knowledge about the disease or special frailty of the victim, nor an intention to cause death or bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the offence will not be murder, even if the injury which caused the death, was intentionally given",5
41,In cl,5
41,"3) of Section 300, instead of the words ""likely to cause death"" occurring in the corresponding cl",5
41,"b) of Section 299, the words ""sufficient in the ordinary course of nature"" have been used",5
41,"Obviously, the distinction lies between a bodily injury likely to cause death and a bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death",5
41,"The distinction is fine but real and if overlooked, may result in miscarriage of justice",5
41,The difference between cl,5
41,b) of S. 299 and cl,5
41,3) of S. 300 is one of degree of probability of death resulting from the intended bodily injury,5
41,"To put it more broadly, it is the degree of probability of death which determines whether a culpable homicide is of the gravest, medium or the lowest degree",5
41,"The word ""likely"" in cl",5
41,b) of S. 299 conveys the sense of probable as distinguished from a mere possibility,5
41,"The words ""bodily injury ... sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death"" mean that death will be the ""most probable"" result of the injury, having regard to the ordinary course of nature",5
41,"For cases to fall within clause (3), it is not necessary that the offender intended to cause death, so long as the death ensues from the intentional bodily injury or injuries sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature",5
41,Rajwant Singh v. State of Kerala is an apt illustration of this point,5
41,In Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab4,5
41,"1958 Indlaw SC 82 Vivian Bose, J. speaking for the Court, explained the meaning and scope of cl",5
41,"It was observed that the prosecution must prove the following facts before it can bring a case under S. 300 ""thirdly",5
41,"First, it must establish quite objectively, that a bodily injury is present; secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved",5
41,These are purely objective investigations,5
41,"Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional or that some other kind of injury was intended",5
41,"Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds further, and fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described made up of the three elements set out above was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature",5
41,This part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender,5
41,"The ingredients of clause ""thirdly"" of S. 300 IPC were brought out by the illustrious Judge in his terse language as follows: ""12",5
41,"To put it shortly, the prosecution must prove the following facts before it can bring a case under S. 300 'thirdly'; First, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is present; Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely objective investigations",5
41,"Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended",5
41,"Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds further and, Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature",5
41,"The learned Judge explained the third ingredient in the following words ""The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious injury or a trivial one but whether he intended to inflict the injury that is proved to be present",5
41,"If he can show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such an inference, then, of course, the intent that the section requires is not proved",5
41,"But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to inflict it",5
41,"Whether he knew of its seriousness, or intended serious consequences, is neither here nor there",5
41,"The question, so far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill, or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness, but whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite conclusion",5
41,"These observations of Vivian Bose, J. have become locus classicus",5
41,"The test laid down by Virsa Singh case4 for the applicability of clause ""thirdly"" is now ingrained in our legal system and has become part of the rule of law",5
41,"Under clause thirdly of S. 300 IPC, culpable homicide is murder, if both the following conditions are satisfied i.e. (a) that the act which causes death is done with the intention of causing death or is done with the intention of causing a bodily injury; and (b) that the injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death",5
41,"It must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury which, in the ordinary course of nature, was sufficient to cause death viz",5
41,that the injury found to be present was the injury that was intended to be inflicted,5
41,"Thus, according to the rule laid down in Virsa Singh case4 even if the intention of the accused was limited to the infliction of a bodily injury sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature, and did not extend to the intention of causing death, the offence would be murder",5
41,Illustration (c) appended to S. 300 clearly brings out this point,5
41,c) of S. 299 and cl,5
41,4) of S. 300 both require knowledge of the probability of the act causing death,5
41,It is not necessary for the purpose of this case to dilate much on the distinction between these corresponding clauses,5
41,It will be sufficient to say that cl,5
41,"4) of S. 300 would be applicable where the knowledge of the offender as to the probability of death of a person or persons in general as distinguished from a particular person or persons -- being caused from his imminently dangerous act, approximates to a practical certainty",5
41,"Such knowledge on the part of the offender must be of the highest degree of probability, the act having been committed by the offender without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid",5
41,The above are only broad guidelines and not cast-iron imperatives,5
41,"In most cases, their observance will facilitate the task of the court",5
41,"But sometimes the facts are so intertwined and the second and the third stages so telescoped into each, that it may not be convenient to give a separate treatment to the matters involved in the second and third stages",5
41,The aforesaid principles have been consistently followed by this Court in several decisions,5
41,"Reference in this regard may be made to the decision of this Court in Ruli Ram v. State of Haryana, (2002) 7 SCC 691 2002 Indlaw SC 1927; Augustine Saldanha v.

41,"That being the well settled legal position, when we test the factual background of the present case on the principles laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions, we are unable to agree with the views taken by the High Court",1
41,"As already noted, it is quite clear from the record that there was an altercation preceding the incident",1
41,The place of occurrence is a residence inhabited by both the parties and there is no evidence on record that the deceased was armed with any weapon,1
41,Initially the accused-appellant also did not have any weapon with him but during the course of the incident he went inside and got a knife with the help of which he stabbed the deceased,1
41,PW-7,1
41,in his cross examination has categorically stated that death due to stab injury was in consequence of Injury No. 1 and all other injuries were superficial in nature,1
41,"So, it was only Injury No. 1 which was fatal in nature",1
41,"Factually therefore, there was only one main injury caused due to stabbing and that also was given on the back side of the deceased and therefore, it cannot be said that there was any intention to kill or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness",1
41,Records clearly establish that there was indeed a scuffle between the parties with regard to the availability of electricity in a particular room and during the course of scuffle the appellant also received an injury which was simple in nature and that there was heated exchange of words and scuffle between the parties before the actual incident of stabbing took place,1
41,"There is, therefore, provocation and the incident happened at the spur of the moment",1
41,"That being the factual position, we are of the considered view that the present case cannot be said to be a case u/s",1
41,but it is a case falling under S. 304 Part II IPC,1
41,It is trite law that S. 304 Part II comes into play when the death is caused by doing an act with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but there is no intention on the part of the accused either to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death,1
41,"Accordingly, we convict the appellant under Section 304, Part II of IPC and sentence him to undergo imprisonment for a period of 7 years",4
41,His bail bonds shall stand cancelled and the appellant shall surrender immediately to serve out the remaining period of sentence,4
41,"If, however, the appellant does not surrender by himself, the State shall take necessary steps to rearrest him to undergo the remaining part of sentence",4
41,The appeal stands disposed of in terms of aforesaid order,4
41,Appeal disposed of,4
44,"This appeal is directed against the final judgment and order dated 03.10.2007 passed by the High Court of Judicature,Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad in Criminal Appeal No.436 of 2001 whereby the High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant herein and confirmed the judgment dated 19.03.2001 passed by the Special Judge,C.B.I.Cases,Visakhapatnam in C.C.No.2 of 1998",6
44,"Brief facts: ""(a) The appellant-accused was working as a Head Clerk in the Traffic Cadre Section in the Office of the Senior Divisional Personnel Officer,South Central Railway,Vijayawada during the period from April,1992 to November,1997.The nature of duties of the appellant-accused included dealing with and processing of the matters like promotions,transfers,seniority list,roster list,pay fixation on promotions,retirements,resignations etc.of the personnel",6
44,b,1
44,"One K.Rama Rao-the Complainant,who was examined as PW-1,was posted as Yard Points Man,Grade 'A' under Station Superintendent,South Central Railway,Tanuku from December,1995 to June,1997.In June,1997,due to excess staff at Tanuku",6
44,"he was instructed to report at Head Quarters,Vijayawada and accordingly,when he reported there,he was asked to go back to Tanuku",6
44,"Thereafter,he went back to Tanuku from where he was subsequently transferred to Rajahmundry",6
44,"Thereafter,PW-1 made a representation to his senior officer requesting him for posting at Vijayawada,Cheerala,Vetapalam or Tenali",6
44,"Later,PW-1 was transferred to Vijayawada",6
44,c,1
44,"As the appellant-accused was dealing with the transfers,the complainant (PW-1) met him on 05.11.1997 at his office to pursue about the issuance of the said transfer order",6
44,"The appellant-accused asked him to come on 10.11.1997.When he met him on 10.11.1997,the appellant asked him to come on the next day as he was busy in pay-fixation work",6
44,"On 11.11.1997,again he went to the office of the appellant but he could not find him on his seat",6
44,Again a day after i.e.on,6
44,"13.11.1997,when he met the appellant-accused,he informed him that his request for transfer has been processed and the order is ready and the same has been placed before the A.P.O.for signature and asked him to come on the next day,i.e.,on 14.11.1997,and demanded Rs.200/-for releasing the said office order",6
44,d,1
44,"On the same day,(PW-1) reported the matter in writing to the Inspector of Police,Central Bureau of Investigation (in short 'the CBI),Vijayawada",6
44,"On 14.11.1997,a trap was laid by the CBI officials along with panchas and when the accused demanded and accepted a sum of Rs.200/-as illegal gratification,he was caught red handed along with the money which was recovered from the right hand side pocket of his pant",6
44,e,1
44,"On 15.11.1997,at 7.30 a.m.,an FIR was registered by the Inspector,CBI,Visakhapatnam Branch in Crime No.RC 20(A)/97-VSP.After recording the statements of the witnesses,Inspector of Police,CBI,Visakhapatnam filed charge sheet being No.2/98-YTR dated 29.04.1998 against the appellant-accused for an offence punishable under Sections 7,13(1)(d)(ii) read with S.13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act,1988 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act"") in the Court of Special Judge for CBI Cases at Visakhapatnam",6
44,f,1
44,"The Special Judge,CBI,by order dated 19.03.2001,convicted the appellant and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-and,in default,to suffer simple imprisonment for one month for the offence punishable u/s.7 of the Act and one year rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.500/-and,in default,to suffer simple imprisonment for one month for the offence punishable u/ss.13(1)(d) (ii",6
44,read with S.13(2) of the Act,6
44,"g) Against the said order,the appellant-accused filed Criminal Appeal No.436 of 2001 before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh",6
44,"The High Court,by impugned judgment dated 03.10.2007 dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant-accused and confirmed the conviction passed by the trial Court",6
44,"Hence,the appellant-accused has preferred this appeal by way of special leave petition before this Court",6
44,Heard Mr,6
44,"ATM Rangaramanujam,learned senior counsel for the appellant and Mr",6
44,"Harish Chandra,learned senior counsel for the respondent",6
44,Notice only on quantum of sentence-hearing on all aspects,6
44,Permissibility,1
44,"On 28.01.2008,this Court consisting of three Hon'ble Judges issued notice in this matter confining to the quantum of sentence only",6
44,"In pursuance of the same,we permitted Mr",6
44,"Rangaramanujam,learned senior counsel for the appellant to address his arguments confining to quantum of sentence imposed on the appellant-accused",6
44,"As stated in the narration of facts,the appellant was convicted u/s.7 of the Act for which he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-,in default,simple imprisonment for one month",6
44,"He was also convicted for the offence under S.13(1)(d)(ii) read with S.13(2) of the Act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and fine of Rs.500/-,in default,simple imprisonment for one month",6
44,The trial Court ordered that both the sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently,6
44,The said conviction and sentence was affirmed by the High Court,6
44,"If we confine ourselves to the limited extent of notice dated 28.01.2008,we have to hear both sides only on the quantum of sentence",6
44,"However,Mr.Rangaramanujam,learned senior counsel for the appellant by drawing our attention to the recent judgment of this Court in Yomeshbhai Pranshankar Bhatt vs",2
44,"State of Gujarat,(2011) 6 SCC 312 2011 Indlaw SC 370,submitted that in spite of limited notice,this Court,while exercising jurisdiction u/art.142 of the Constitution,in order to do complete justice while hearing the matter finally can go into the merits of the orders passed by the trial Court and the High Court",2
44,"In the reported case,the appeal was against the concurrent finding of both the courts convicting the appellant u/s.302 IPC and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for life",2
44,"At the SLP stage,this Court,by order dated 27.07.2009,issued notice confined only to the question as to whether the petitioner was guilty of commission of an offence under any of the parts of S.304 Indian Penal Code,1860 (in short 'IPC') and not u/s.302 IPC.Similar request was made before the Bench that the appellant was entitled to urge all the questions including his right to urge that he should have been acquitted in the facts and circumstances of the case",2
44,"This Court,referred to the Supreme Court Rules,1966 which have been framed u/art.145 of the Constitution and also considered scope of its power u/art.142 as well as Order 47",2
44,"Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908",2
44,"in short 'the Code).While deciding the said question,the Bench has also considered the scope of S.100 of the Code for entertaining the second appeal",2
44,"It further shows that the Court considered the plea of the appellant therein for acquittal despite the fact that the notice was limited in terms of the order dated 27.07.2009.It is relevant to point out that the Bench in para 18,clarified the position and reopened the case in its entirety even though notice was issued confining to a particular aspect",2
44,"After permitting the appellant therein to argue the case for acquittal on merits,it observed: "" .......We,however,make it clear that this cannot be a universal practice in all cases",2
44,The question whether the Court will enlarge the scope of its inquiry at the time of final hearing depends on the facts and circumstances of the case,2
44,"Since in the facts of this case,we find that the appellant should be heard on all points,we have come to the aforesaid conclusion",2
44,Emphasis supplied,0
44,"It is clear that the Bench itself has clarified that they are not laying down the law that in spite of issuing notice confining to a particular aspect (in the case on hand -""quantum of sentence"") the parties are entitled to urge all points and re-open the case as if they are free to do the same without any restriction",1
44,"As a matter of fact,the last sentence in para 18 makes it clear that in the facts and circumstances of that case,they permitted the appellants to urge all points on merits",1
44,"In the case on hand,it is to be noted that on appreciation of oral and documentary evidence led in by the prosecution and the defence and on appreciation of entire materials,the court of first instance i.e.the trial Court convicted the appellant and sentenced him as mentioned above",1
44,"The High Court,as an appellate Court,once again analysed all the material,discussed the oral and documentary evidence and finding that the prosecution had proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt concurred with the conclusion arrived at by the trial Court and dismissed the appeal of the appellant",1
44,"Inasmuch as both the courts have thoroughly discussed the oral and documentary evidence with reference to the charges leveled against the appellant and in view of the limited order dated 28.01.2008 by this Court issuing notice confining to quantum of sentence only and even applying the analogy enunciated in Yomeshbhai 2011 Indlaw SC 370 (supra),we feel that it is not a case of such nature that the appellant should be heard on all points,consequently,we reject the request of the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant",1
44,Quantum of sentence,1
44,Whether requires any reduction,1
44,Mr,2
44,"Rangaramanujam,learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that inasmuch as the alleged incident took place on 14.11.1997 and 14 years have elapsed since then,the amount of Rs.200/-said to have been received by the appellant is trivial in nature and also of the fact that due to the said conviction and sentence he lost his job,leniency may be shown and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone",2
44,"He fairly admitted that out of the maximum period of one year,the appellant had served only 52 days in prison",2
44,"With this factual position,let us consider whether the request of the learned senior counsel for the appellant is to be accepted and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone",2
44,"It is not in dispute that the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act,1988 alone are applicable since the incident occurred on 14.11.1997 i.e.subsequent to the Act",1
44,S.7 of the Act relates to public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act,1
44,"If the said offence/charge is proved,the court has no other option but to impose sentence of imprisonment which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and also liable to fine",1
44,"The said section reads as under:- "" Public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act.-Whoever,being,or expecting to be a public servant,accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person,for himself or for any other person,any gratification whatever,other than legal remuneration,as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for showing or forbearing to show,in the exercise of his official functions,favour or disfavor to any person or for rendering or attempting to render any service or disservice to any person,with the Central Government or any State Government or Parliament or the Legislature of any State or with any local authority,corporation or Government company referred to in Cl.(c) of Section 2,or with any public servant,whether named or otherwise shall,be punishable with imprisonment which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine........."" (Emphasis supplied",0
44,S.13 deals with criminal misconduct by a public servant,0
44,As per sub-s.(2) if any public servant commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine,0
44,"For clarity,we reproduce the said section hereunder: "" Criminal misconduct by a public servant.-(1",0
44,"A public servant is said to commit the offence of criminal misconduct, (a) If he habitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person for himself or for any other person any gratification other than legal remuneration as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in Section 7; or (b) If he habitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain for himself or for any other person,any valuable thing without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate from any person whom he knows to have been,or to be,or to be likely to he concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by him or having any connection with the official functions of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate,or from any,person whom he knows to be interests in or related to the person so concerned; or (c",0
44,If he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriates or otherwise converts for his own use any property entrusted to him or under his control as a public servant or allows any other person so to do; or (d,0
44,"If he,- (i",0
44,"By corrupt or illegal means,obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or Pecuniary advantage; or (ii) By abusing his position as a public servant,obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage; or (iii",0
44,"While holding office as a public servant,obtains for any person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage without any public interest; or (e) If he or any person on his behalf,is in possession or has,at any time during the Period of his office,been in possession for which the public servant cannot satisfactorily account,of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known sources of income",0
44,Explanation,0
44,"For the purposes of this section ""known sources of income"" means income received from any lawful source and such receipt has been intimated in accordance,with the provisions of any law,rules or orders for the time being applicable to public servant",0
44,Any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine,0
44,"It is useful to refer that in the Prevention of Corruption Act,1947 the same ""criminal misconduct"" which is available in S.13 of the 1988 Act had been dealt with in S.5 of the 1947 Act",0
44,S.5(2) of the 1947 Act mandates that any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine,0
44,"However,proviso to sub-s.(2) of S.5 gives power to the court that for any special reasons to be recorded in writing,impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than one year",0
44,Such relaxation in the form of a proviso has been done away with in the 1988 Act,0
44,"To put it clear,in the 1988 Act,if an offence u/s.7 is proved,the same is punishable with imprisonment which shall be not less than six months and in the case of Section 13,it shall not be less than one year",0
44,No other interpretation is permissible,0
44,Other circumstances pleaded for reduction of sentence,1
44,"In order to substantiate the claim with the regard to the above,learned senior counsel for the appellant has relied on the decision of this Court in Bechaarbhai S.Prajapati vs",2
44,"State of Gujarat,(2008) 11 SCC 163 2008 Indlaw SC 297 and based on the same requested this Court to modify the sentence to the extent of period already undergone",2
44,We have gone through the facts in that case,1
44,"It is true that even in the cited decision,the appellant accused demanded only Rs.250/-and it was paid and accepted",1
44,"Finally,the Special Judge framed charges for offence punishable under Sections 7,12,13(1)(d) read with S.13(2) of the Act",1
44,The appellant therein was convicted for offence u/s.7(2) of the Act and appeal before the High Court was also dismissed,1
44,"Thereafter,the same was challenged before this Court",1
44,"This Court,after holding that the conclusion of the trial Court and High Court does not suffer from any infirmity considered the alternative submission which related to harshness of sentence",1
44,"In that case,taking note of the fact that the occurrence took place nearly seven years back and also of the fact that the appellant had suffered custody for more than six months,considering all these aspects,while maintaining the conviction,this Court reduced the sentence to the period already undergone",1
44,Since the appellant therein was convicted only u/s.7 and S.161 Cr,1
44,"PC.,the minimum sentence being six months and of the fact that he had suffered custody for more than six months,the course adopted by this Court is perfectly in order and the same cannot be applied to the case on hand,wherein the appellant had undergone only 52 days when the minimum sentence was six months u/s.7 and one year u/s.13",1
44,"Learned senior counsel for the appellant further submitted that inasmuch as the incident had occurred on 14.11.1997 and the trial Court has convicted him on 19.03.2001 which was affirmed by the High Court on 03.10.2007,at this juncture,i.e.,after a gap of 14 years,there is no need to retain the same sentence and the Court is not justified in directing the appellant to serve the remaining period after such a long time",2
44,There is no dispute as regards the date of occurrence and the date of conviction passed by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court,1
44,"Inasmuch as the conviction on both counts have been confirmed by this Court and we are confined to sentence part alone and in view of the minimum sentence prescribed u/ss.7 and 13 of the Act,we are of the view that though long delay may be a ground for reduction of sentence in other cases,the same may not be applicable to the case on hand when the statute prescribes minimum sentence",1
44,"Accordingly,we reject the said contention",1
44,It was further contended that the amount alleged to have been received by the appellant accused is only Rs.200/-and he also lost his job after conviction by the trial court,2
44,"Though,these grounds may be attractive in respect of other offences where minimum sentence is not prescribed,in view of our reasonings in the earlier paras,the same cannot be applied to the case on hand",1
44,"About the request based on delay that the appellant has lost his job,undergone the ordeal all along etc.a lenient view be taken in this case,it is useful to refer decision of this Court in State of M.P.vs",5
44,Shambhu Dayal,5
44,"Nagar,(2006) 8 SCC 693 2006",5
44,"Indlaw SC 716 wherein it was held that: "" It is difficult to accept the prayer of the respondent that a lenient view be taken in this case",5
44,The corruption by public servants has become a gigantic problem,5
44,It has spread everywhere,5
44,No facet of public activity has been left unaffected by the stink of corruption,5
44,It has deep and pervasive impact on the functioning of the entire country,5
44,Large-scale corruption retards the nation-building activities and everyone has to suffer on that count,5
44,As has been aptly observed in Swatantar Singh v,5
44,"State of Haryana,(1997) 4 SCC 14 1997 Indlaw SC 1061,corruption is corroding,like cancerous lymph nodes,the vital veins of the body politics,social fabric of efficiency in the public service and demoralising the honest officers",5
44,"The efficiency in public service would improve only when the public servant devotes his sincere attention and does the duty diligently,truthfully,honestly and devotes himself assiduously to the performance of the duties of his post",5
44,The reputation of corrupt would gather thick and unchaseable clouds around the conduct of the officer and gain notoriety much faster than the smoke,5
44,Art.142 and its applicability,5
44,"By drawing our attention to Art.142 of the Constitution of India,learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that in order to do complete justice,this Court has ample power to reduce the sentence even to the extent of period already undergone or any other order which would be beneficial to the parties approaching this Court",2
44,"Similar claim based on Art.142 has been negatived in several decisions by this Court,we need to refer only the latest decision of this Court in Manish Goel vs",5
44,"Rohini Goel,(2010) 4 SCC 393 2010 Indlaw SC 301.The facts in that case are that the parties by persuasion of the family members and friends,entered into a compromise and prepared a memorandum of understanding dated 13.11.2009,in the proceedings pending before the Mediation Centre,Delhi,by which they agreed on terms and conditions incorporated therein,to settle all their disputes and also for dissolution of their marriage",5
44,"The parties filed an application under Section 13-B(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 before the Family Court,Delhi seeking divorce by mutual consent",5
44,The said HMA No.456 of 2009 came before the court and it recorded the statement of parties on 16.11.2009.The parties moved another HMA No.457 of 2009 to waive the statutory period of six months in filing the second petition,5
44,"However,the court rejected the said application vide order dated 01.12.2009 observing that the court was not competent to waive the required statutory period of six months under the Act and such a waiver was permissible only under the directions of the Supreme Court as held by this Court in Anil Kumar Jain vs",5
44,"Maya Jain,(2009",5
44,10 SCC 415 2009 Indlaw SC 1494.Hence the parties have approached this Court for appropriate relief,5
44,Speaking for the Bench one of us -(Dr,5
44,Justice B.S.Chauhan) referred to more than fifty decisions including the Constitution Bench judgments,5
44,"The relevant paras,which are useful,may be quoted: "" We are fully alive of the fact that this Court has been exercising the power u/art.142 of the Constitution for dissolution of marriage where the Court finds that marriage is totally unworkable,emotionally dead,beyond salvage and has broken down irretrievably,even if the facts of the case do not provide a ground in law on which the divorce could be granted",5

44,"In Anil Kumar Jain,this Court held that an order of waiving the statutory requirements can be passed only by this Court in exercise of its powers u/art.142 of the Constitution",5
44,The said power is not vested with any other court,5

44,It is not to be exercised in a case where there is no basis in law which can form an edifice for building up a superstructure,5

44,"UT,Chandigarh (2004) 2 SCC 130 2003 Indlaw SC 1504",5
44,"this Court held as under: "" ...sympathy or sentiment by itself cannot be a ground for passing an order in relation whereto the appellants miserably fail to establish a legal right",5
44,"despite an extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction contained in Art.142 of the Constitution of India,this Court ordinarily would not pass an order which would be in contravention of a statutory provision",5
44,In Laxmidas Morarji v,5
44,"Behrose Darab Madan (2009) 10 SCC 425 2009 Indlaw SC 1154,while dealing with the provisions of Art.142 of the Constitution,this Court has held as under:",5
44,"The power u/art.142 of the Constitution is a constitutional power and hence,not restricted by statutory enactments",5
44,"Though the Supreme Court would not pass any order u/art.142 of the Constitution which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject,at the same time these constitutional powers cannot in any way,be controlled by any statutory provisions",5
44,"However,it is to be made clear that this power cannot be used to supplant the law applicable to the case",5
44,"This means that acting under Article 142,the Supreme Court cannot pass an order or grant relief which is totally inconsistent or goes against the substantive or statutory enactments pertaining to the case",5
44,The power is to be used sparingly in cases which cannot be effectively and appropriately tackled by the existing provisions of law or when the existing provisions of law cannot bring about complete justice between the parties,5
44,Emphasis added,5
44,"After elaborately discussing almost all the case laws on this subject about jurisdiction of this Court under Article 142,summarised the same in the following words: Therefore,the law in this regard can be summarised to the effect that in exercise of the power u/art.142 of the Constitution,this Court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy",1
44,"After saying so,the Court rejected the request of the parties to waive the statutory period of six months under the Act",1
44,In Mota Ram vs,5
44,"State of Haryana,(2009) 12 SCC 727 2009 Indlaw SC 682,this Court,while reiterating the above principles has concluded that Art.142 cannot be exercised to negate the statutory provisions",5
44,In Academy of Nutrition Improvement and Others vs,5
44,"Union of India,JT 2011 (8) SC 16 2011 Indlaw SC 515,the following conclusion about the applicability of Art.142 is relevant",5
44,"The question is having held that Rule 44I to be invalid,whether we can permit the continuation of the ban on sale of non-iodised salt for human consumption for any period",5
44,"Art.142 of the Constitution vests unfettered independent jurisdiction to pass any order in public interest to do complete justice,if exercise of such jurisdiction is not be contrary to any express provision of law",5
44,In Supreme Court Bar Association v,5
44,Union of India: 1998 (4) SCC 409,5
44,"1998 Indlaw SC 688,this Court observed: The Supreme Court in exercise of its jurisdiction u/art.142 has the power to make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice ""between the parties in any cause or matter pending before it"".The very nature of the power must lead the court to set limits for itself within which to exercise those powers and ordinarily it cannot disregard a statutory provision governing a subject,except perhaps to balance the equities between the conflicting claims of the litigating parties by ""ironing out the creases"" in a cause or matter before it",5
44,Indeed this Court is not a court of restricted jurisdiction of only dispute settling,5
44,It is well recognised and established that this Court has always been a law maker and its role travels beyond merely dispute settling,5
44,"It is a ""problem solver in the nebulous areas"".(See",5
44,K.Veeraswami v,5
44,Union of India : 1991 (3) SCC 655 1991 Indlaw SC,5
44,"711,but the substantive statutory provisions dealing with the subject matter of a given case,cannot be altogether ignored by this Court,while making an order u/art.142.Indeed,these constitutional powers can not,in any way,be controlled by any statutory provisions but at the same time these powers are not meant to be exercised when their exercise may come directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided for in statute dealing expressly with the subject",5
44,In Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v,5
44,Rajesh Ranjan : 2005 (3,5
44,"SCC 284 2005 Indlaw SC 93,this Court after reiterating that this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction u/art.142 of the Constitution would not pass any order which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable to the case or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject,observed as follows",5
44,It may therefore be understood that the plenary powers of this Court u/art.142 of the Constitution are inherent in the Court and are complementary to those powers which are specifically conferred on the Court by various statutes though are not limited by those statutes .These,5
44,powers also exist independent of the statutes with a view to do complete justice between the parties...and are in the nature of supplementary powers,5
44,and] may be put on a different and perhaps even wider footing than ordinary inherent powers of a court to prevent injustice,5
44,The advantage that is derived from a constitutional provision couched in such a wide compass is that it prevents 'clogging or obstruction of the stream of justice,5
44,See: Supreme Court Bar Association 1998 Indlaw SC 688 (supra,5
44,"Though the jurisdiction of this Court,u/art.142 of the Constitution of India is not in dispute,we make it clear that exercise of such power would,however,depend on the facts and circumstances of each case",1
44,"The High Court,in exercise of its jurisdiction,u/s.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code and this Court",1
44,"u/art.142 of the Constitution,would not ordinarily direct quashing of a case involving crime against the society particularly",1
44,when both the trial Court as also the High Court have found that the charge leveled against the appellant under the Act has been made out and proved by the prosecution by placing acceptable evidence,1
44,"Finally,learned senior counsel for the appellant has cited certain orders of this Court wherein this Court has reduced the period of sentence already undergone while upholding the conviction",2
44,We have perused those orders,1
44,"The orders do not disclose any factual details and the relevant provisions under which the accused was charged/convicted and minimum sentence,if any,as available in the Act as well as the period already undergone",1
44,"In the absence of such details,we are unable to rely on those orders",1
44,"From the analysis of the above decisions and the concerned provisions with which we are concerned,the following principles emerge: ""a) When the Court issues notice confining to particular aspect/sentence,arguments will be heard only to that extent unless some extraordinary circumstance/material is shown to the Court for arguing the matter on all aspects",1
44,"Long delay in disposal of appeal or any other factor may not be a ground for reduction of sentence,particularly,when the statute prescribes minimum sentence",1
44,"In other cases where no such minimum sentence is prescribed,it is open to the Court to consider the delay and its effect and the ultimate decision",1
44,"In a case of corruption by public servant,quantum of amount is immaterial",1
44,Ultimately it depends upon the conduct of the delinquent and the proof regarding demand and acceptance established by the prosecution,1
44,"Merely because the delinquent lost his job due to conviction under the Act may not be a mitigating circumstance for reduction of sentence,particularly,when the Statute prescribes minimum sentence",1
44,"Though Art.142 of the Constitution gives wider power to this Court,waiver of certain period as prescribed in the Statute imposing lesser sentence than the minimum prescribed is not permissible",1
44,"An order,which this Court can make in order to do complete justice between the parties,must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution,but also it cannot even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant Statute",1
44,"In other words,this Court cannot altogether ignore the substantive provisions of a Statute",1

44,"Consequently,the appeal fails and the same is dismissed",1
