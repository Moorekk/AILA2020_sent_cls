It is in the evidence of P.W.I. Braj Lai that when he went to the accused to inquire about the whereabouts of his daughter he saw scratch marks on the face of the accused.	Ratio of the decision
This question was put to the accused but he simply denied as wrong.	Ratio of the decision
No explanation whatsoever has been given by the deceased (?).	Ratio of the decision
We are, therefore, of the view that this clinching evidence against the accused remains unchallenged.	Ratio of the decision
P.W.2, Shakuntala was stated to be aged about 12 or 13 years old at the time of occurrence.	Ratio of the decision
She deposed that at about 5 or 5.30 p.m. she had seen the accused with the victim girl eating "BERS".	Ratio of the decision

In cross examination this witness stated that he had seen the accused after coming back from the marriage party.	Ratio of the decision
Counsel for the respondent contended that the testimony of this witness is not reliable as in cross examination this witness stated that he had witnessed the accused and the deceased only on return from the marriage party.	Argument
According to the counsel for the respondent this witness had gone to the marriage party on the date of incident, he could not have seen the accused and the victim girl together as deposed by him.	Argument
This has been clarified to a question put by the Court by P.W.7 and he categorically admitted that he saw the accused emerging from the field after his return from the marriage party.	Ratio of the decision
This does not mean that he went to the marriage party on the same day.	Ratio of the decision
The High Court, in our view, erroneously held that the evidence of P.Ws. 2, 5, 6 and 7 could not establish the chain of circumstantial evidence only pointing to the guilt of the accused.	Ratio of the decision
By now, it is well settled principle that in order to sustain a conviction of circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must establish that the chain of circumstances only consistently point to the guilt of the accused and inconsistence with his innocence.	Ratio of the decision
A cumulative reading of the evidence of P.Ws. 2, 5, 6 and 7 together with the medical evidence and non explanation of the accused scratch marks on his face, we are of the view that the prosecution has consistently established the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with his innocence.	Ratio of the decision

The impugned order of the High Court acquitting the accused respondent is accordingly quashed and set aside.	Ruling by Present Court
