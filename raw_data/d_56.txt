Hence, this appeal, by special leave, by Accused 2. 	Facts
Mr. Gaurav Agrawal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the instant case rests on circumstantial evidence. 	Argument
Counsel pointed out that the appellant is the brother of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav, the husband of Bindula Devi. 	Argument
PW-10 Sachindra Yadav stated in his evidence that Accused 1 had separated from his other brothers. 	Facts
There is no evidence on record to establish that the appellant was party to any dowry demand or to any ill-treatment meted out to Bindula Devi. 	Argument
Counsel submitted that in cases where apart from husband other members of his family are charged with offences under Sections 304B, 302 and 498A of the IPC and the case rests on circumstantial evidence, unless the circumstantial evidence is of required standard conviction cannot be based on it. 	Argument
In this connection he relied on Vithal Tukaram More & Ors. 	Precedent
v. State of Maharashtra, (2002) 7 SCC 20 2002 Indlaw SC 1622. 	Precedent
Counsel submitted that allegations about motive are vague. 	Argument
Medical evidence is inconclusive. 	Argument
The prosecution has, therefore, failed to establish its case. 	Argument
In any case, since the appellant was residing separately, in the absence of any clinching evidence establishing his complicity he cannot be convicted. 	Argument
Mr. Gopal Singh, learned counsel for the State of Bihar on the other hand submitted that the evidence on record establishes that all the accused were staying in houses situated in the same courtyard. 	Argument
Counsel submitted that evidence of PW-9 Debu Yadav and PW-10 Sachindra Yadav establishes the prosecution case. 	Argument
Pertinently, the accused did not lodge any complaint to the police. 	Argument
The fact that they left the house with all their belongings suggests their complicity. 	Argument
Counsel submitted that Bindula Devi disappeared from the house of the accused. 	Argument
As to how she died in suspicious circumstances was within the knowledge of the accused. 	Argument
The burden was shifted to the accused which they have not discharged. 	Argument
Adverse inference must be drawn against the accused. 	Argument
In this connection, counsel relied on Balaram Prasad Agrawal v. State of Bihar & Ors, (1997) 9 SCC 338 1996 Indlaw SC 1761. 	Precedent
Counsel submitted that appeal be, therefore, dismissed. 	Argument
We have already referred to the evidence of father of Bindula Devi PW- 9 Debu Yadav. 	Facts
He has given a graphic account of the harassment and ill- treatment meted out to the deceased by the accused. 	Facts
They were not happy with a bullock, a cow and a buffalo which were given as dowry. 	Facts
They asked for a watch and a cycle. 	Facts
That was also given. 	Facts
They asked for more. 	Facts
PW-9 Debu Yadav transferred 2 kathas of land to Bindula Devi. 	Facts
The accused wanted to sell it or wanted it to be transferred in their names and since Bindula Devi did not agree to that they continued to torture her. 	Facts
Her son was sent to her father so that he would be brought up by him, but she was kept in the matrimonial house obviously to work. 	Facts
PW-10 Sachindra Yadav the brother of Bindula Devi has corroborated his father. 	Facts
It is distressing to note that all the other witnesses, that is PW-2 to PW-7 turned hostile. 	Ratio of the decision
In the facts of this case, it is indeed a pointer to the guilt of the accused. 	Ratio of the decision
They won over the prosecution witnesses. 	Ratio of the decision
We note with some anguish the following sentences uttered by PW-9 Debu Yadav in his cross-examination probably as an answer to the usual question about there being no independent witness to depose about cruelty. 	Ratio of the decision
He stated "whenever my daughter visited my house, she used to complain that she is being tortured and assaulted there. 	Facts
Who else can be a witness to this fact?" Having perused the evidence of PWs-9 and 10 we have no manner of doubt that Bindula Devi was subjected to cruelty and harassment for dowry by the accused. 	Facts
Evidence of these witnesses is straightforward and honest. 	Ratio of the decision
There is no exaggeration. 	Ratio of the decision
In the cross-examination their evidence has not suffered any dent. 	Ratio of the decision
Implicit reliance can be placed on them. 	Ratio of the decision
It is submitted that the appellant had separated from Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav and, hence, he cannot be a party to the alleged acts of cruelty of the other accused. 	Facts
We find no substance in this submission. 	Ratio of the decision
Though, PW-10 Sachindra Yadav stated that Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav had separated from his brothers after marriage, he has clarified that all the brothers have their houses in a common courtyard. 	Facts
PW-9 Debu Yadav has specifically named the appellant as a person who demanded cattle. 	Facts
He has stated that the accused were not satisfied with the cattle given by him. 	Facts
They demanded more dowry. 	Facts
They used to harass and assault Bindula Devi. 	Facts
He stated that when he went to the house of the accused after receiving information that she had left their house, he found the house to be empty. 	Facts
All the accused had absconded. 	Facts
They had taken their belongings with them. 	Facts
This is confirmed by PW-13 Surendra Rai the Investigating Officer. 	Facts
He stated that when he went to the house of the accused after receiving information about disappearance of Bindula Devi he found the house completely empty. 	Facts
Even the household articles and food grains were missing. 	Facts
The accused were not present. 	Facts
No member of their family was present. 	Facts
Bindula Devi was also not present. 	Facts
These circumstances persuade us to reject the submission that the appellant did not join the other accused in treating Bindula Devi with cruelty. 	Ratio of the decision
The conviction and sentence of the appellant under Section 498A of the IPC is therefore perfectly justified. 	Ratio of the decision
We now come to the death of Bindula Devi. 	Ratio of the decision
PW-9 Debu Yadav and PW-10 Schindra Yadav stated that dead body of Bindula Devi was recovered from the river bed. 	Facts
The Investigating Officer PW-13 Surendra Rai stated that after recording the FIR of PW-9 Debu Yadav, he inspected the house of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav. 	Facts
The dead body of Bindula Devi was found lying 600 yards away from the house of the accused. 	Facts
It was lying in one foot deep water, close to the southern bank of the river, near a ferry. 	Facts
The ferry was situated adjacent to the maize field of Hazari Mandal. 	Facts
He took it out and prepared inquest report. 	Facts
He further stated that one Vinod stated that on 29/1/1989, the accused had a meeting. 	Facts
On 30/1/1989, they left for some other place and in the evening it was revealed that they had killed Bindula Devi by poisoning her and had thrown her dead body at the ferry. 	Facts
The Investigating Officer further stated that Vinod, Parmeshvari Yadav, Brij Bihari Yadav also confirmed this fact. 	Facts
All these persons turned hostile in the court. 	Facts
PW-12 Dr. Arun Kumar Mandal did the post-mortem on the dead body of Bindula Devi. 	Facts
Following are his observations: 	Facts
(1) Epistaxis from both nostrils. 	Facts
(2) Blood mixed with froth from mouth. 	Facts
(3) Both eye balls congested, cornea hazy. 	Facts
(4) Face congested and cyanosed. 	Facts
(5) Skin of both hands and feet were corrugated. 	Facts
On opening of skull all the blood vessels were congested in the maninges and brain matter. 	Facts
In the chest both the lungs were found congested, frothy and spongy and on cutting blood stains froth found in segments. 	Facts
In the heart both chambers were found full. 	Facts
In the stomach semi-digested food about 4 ounces with blood mixed. 	Facts
In the small intestine-gas and solid facees. 	Facts
In the large intestine-gas and solid facees. 	Facts
In the case of kidneys both were found congested. 	Facts
Liver an spleen were also found congested. 	Facts
Uterus contained about full term dead male baby." 	Facts
PW-12 Dr. Arun Kumar Mandal opined that the cause of death was asphaxia due to drowning. 	Facts
He stated that in cases of drowning, if immediate death is caused, then, there will be negligible quantum of water in the stomach. 	Facts
He further stated that death may be caused even in one foot deep water if the victim is kept in water with his neck pressed in sleeping position. 	Facts
It may be stated here that report of the viscera examination is not on record. 	Ratio of the decision
Dr. Mandal has admitted that he did not know the result of viscera examination. 	Ratio of the decision
He added that there were no injuries on the person of the deceased. 	Facts
In our opinion, the evidence of the father and the brother of Bindula Devi and other attendant circumstances such as strong motive; the fact that the accused did not lodge any complaint about missing of Bindula Devi; that Accused 6 Fudai Yadav went to the house of PW-9 Debu Yadav to enquire about Bindula Devi and then suddenly deserted PWs 9 and 10 when they were going to the house of the accused, that all the accused absconded from their house with their belongings and that the house was completely empty, lead to an irresistible conclusion that the accused were responsible for the death of Bindula Devi. 	Ratio of the decision
It is submitted that since there were no injuries on the dead body of Bindula Devi, it would be wrong to conclude that Bindula Devi was kept in water in a sleeping position with her neck pressed as suggested by the doctor. 	Facts
The prosecution story that the accused caused her death must therefore be rejected. 	Facts
Medical evidence, it is argued, does not support the prosecution case. 	Facts
In our opinion, the prosecution having established that the accused treated the deceased with cruelty and that they subjected her to harassment for dowry, the accused ought to have disclosed the facts which were in their personal and special knowledge to disprove the prosecution case that they murdered Bindula Devi. 	Ratio of the decision
section 106 of the Evidence Act covers such a situation. 	Statute
The burden which had shifted to the accused was not discharged by them. 	Ratio of the decision
In this connection, we may usefully refer to the judgment of this Court in Shambhu Nath Mehra v. State of Ajmer, AIR 1956 SC 404 1956 Indlaw SC 81 where this Court explained how section 101 and section 106 of the Evidence Act operate. 	Precedent
Relevant portion of the said judgment reads thus: 	Precedent
"(10) section 106 is an exception to section 101. 	Precedent
section 101 lays down the general rule about the burden of proof. 	Precedent
'Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist'. 	Precedent
Illustration (a) says - 	Precedent
'A desires a Court to give judgment that B shall be punished for a crime which A says B has committed. 	Precedent
A must prove that B has committed the crime'. 	Precedent
(11) This lays down the general rule that in a criminal case, the burden of proof is on the prosecution and section 106 is certainly not intended to relieve it of that duty. 	Ratio of the decision
On the contrary, it is designed to meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, for the prosecution to establish facts which are 'especially' within the knowledge of the accused and which he could prove without difficulty or inconvenience." 	Ratio of the decision
In Balram Prasad Agrawal v. State of Bihar, (1997) 9 SCC 338 1996 Indlaw SC 1761, the prosecution had established the cruel conduct of the accused i.e. her husband and members of his family and the sufferings undergone by the deceased at their hands. 	Precedent
The unbearable conduct of the accused ultimately resulted in her death by drowning in the well in the courtyard of the accused's house. 	Precedent
This Court observed that what happened on the fateful night and what led to the deceased's falling in the well was wholly within the personal and special knowledge of the accused. 	Precedent
But they kept mum on this aspect. 	Precedent
This Court observed that it is true that the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. 	Precedent
But once the prosecution is found to have shown that the accused were guilty of persistent conduct of cruelty qua the deceased spread over years as was well established from the unshaken testimony of father of the deceased, the facts which were in the personal knowledge of the accused who were present in the house on that fateful night could have been revealed by them to disprove the prosecution case. 	Precedent
This Court observed that the accused had not discharged the burden which had shifted to them under section 106 of the Evidence Act. 	Precedent
While coming to this conclusion, this Court relied on Shambhu Nath Mehra. 	Precedent
In the present case, the deceased was admittedly in the custody of the accused. 	Ratio of the decision
She disappeared from their house. 	Ratio of the decision
As to how her dead body was found in the river was within their special and personal knowledge. 	Ratio of the decision
They could have revealed the facts to disprove the prosecution case that they had killed Bindula Devi. 	Ratio of the decision
They failed to discharge the burden which had shifted to them under section 106 of the Evidence Act. 	Ratio of the decision
The prosecution is not expected to give the exact manner in which the deceased was killed. 	Ratio of the decision
Adverse inference needs to be drawn against the accused as they failed to explain how the deceased was found dead in the river in one foot deep water. 	Ratio of the decision
Pertinently, the post-mortem notes do not indicate presence of huge amount of water in the dead body. 	Facts
According to PW-12 Dr. Mandal, in a case of drowning, if immediate death is caused, then, there will be negligible quantum of water in the stomach. 	Ratio of the decision
From the evidence of PW-12 Dr. Mandal, it appears that the death of Bindula Devi occurred immediately after she was drowned in the water because there was not much water in her stomach. 	Ratio of the decision
It is also pertinent to note that Bindula Devi was pregnant. 	Facts
Her uterus contained full term dead male baby. 	Facts
She could not have, therefore, offered any resistance. 	Ratio of the decision
It appears that, therefore, there were no injuries on the dead body. 	Ratio of the decision
The whole operation appears to have been done swiftly and skillfully. 	Ratio of the decision
But in any case, as stated hereinabove, it is not for the prosecution to explain in what manner Bindula Devi was done to death by the accused because Bindula Devi was staying in the house of the accused prior to the occurrence and she disappeared from that house. 	Ratio of the decision
All the circumstances leading to her unnatural death were within the special and personal knowledge of the accused which they chose not to disclose. 	Ratio of the decision
Instead, they gave a totally false explanation that when Bindula Devi had gone for bath, she slipped, got drowned in the water and died. 	Ratio of the decision
This story is palpably false. 	Ratio of the decision
The false explanation offered by the accused further strengthens the prosecution case as it becomes an additional link in the chain of circumstances. 	Ratio of the decision
It is true that in Vithal Tukaram More this Court has held that in a case where other members of the husband's family are charged with offences under Sections 304B, 302 and 498A of the IPC and the case rests on circumstantial evidence, the circumstantial evidence must be of required standard if conviction has to be based on it. 	Precedent
We are of the considered opinion that the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this case is of required standard. 	Ratio of the decision
No other inference, except that of the guilt of the accused, is possible on the basis of the evidence on record. 	Ratio of the decision
The established facts are consistent only with the hypothesis of their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence. 	Ratio of the decision
The appeal, therefore, deserves to be dismissed. 	Ratio of the decision
Before we part, we must refer to a very vital aspect of this case. 	Ratio of the decision
PW-9 Debu Yadav, the father of Bindula Devi stated that the neighbours told him that Bindula Devi was poisoned by the accused. 	Facts
PW-10 Sachindra Yadav, brother of Bindula Devi has also stated so. 	Facts
PW-13 Surendra Rai, the Investigating Officer went a step further. 	Facts
He stated that Vinod Yadav, Shiv Pujan Ram, Vinod Kumar Mehta, Parmeshwar Yadav and Braj Bihari Yadav told him that the accused had killed Bindula Devi by poisoning her; that they had concealed the dead body in the river and had run away. 	Facts
Unfortunately, these witnesses turned hostile. 	Facts
But the fact remains that the prosecution had come out with a case of poisoning. 	Facts
It was, therefore, necessary for the prosecution to get the viscera examined from Forensic Science Laboratory ("the FSL"). 	Ratio of the decision
The trial court has observed that the Investigating Officer had filed a petition on 19/4/1988 requesting the doctor to send the viscera for chemical analysis to the FSL, Patna. 	Ruling by Lower Court
Post-mortem notes mention that viscera was protected for future needs. 	Facts
This is also stated by PW-12 Dr. Mandal. 	Facts
Dr. Mandal has, however, added that he did not know the result of viscera examination. 	Facts
From the evidence of the Investigating Officer, PW-13 Surendra Rai, it appears that the doctor did not send the viscera to the FSL. 	Ratio of the decision
When he was questioned about the viscera report, the Investigating Officer stated in the cross-examination that a letter had been sent to the doctor about viscera examination. 	Facts
He further stated that he did not make any complaint against the doctor to the senior officers, but, informed his officer through diary. 	Facts
We are of the opinion that the doctor ought to have sent the viscera to the FSL when he was requested to do so. 	Ratio of the decision
On his failure to do so, the Investigating Officer should have informed his superior officer and taken steps to ensure that viscera is sent to the FSL rather than just making a diary entry. 	Ratio of the decision
Such a supine indifference has a disastrous effect on the criminal justice administration system. 	Ratio of the decision
We are aware that in some cases where there is other clinching evidence on record to establish the case of poisoning, this Court has proceeded to convict the accused even in the absence of viscera report. 	Ratio of the decision
In Bhupendra v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 2013 (13) SCALE 52 2013 Indlaw SC 736 this Court was concerned with a case where the viscera report was not on record, but, there was enough evidence of poisoning. 	Precedent
The accused was charged under Sections 304-B and 306 of the IPC. 	Precedent
Drawing support from the presumptions under Sections 113B and 113A of the Evidence Act, 1872 and, after referring to relevant judgments on the point, this Court held that death of the deceased was caused by poisoning. 	Precedent
The relevant observation of this Court could be quoted. 	Precedent
These decisions clearly bring out that a chemical examination of the viscera is not mandatory in every case of a dowry death; even when a viscera report is sought for, its absence is not necessarily fatal to the case of the prosecution when an unnatural death punishable under Section 304-B of the IPC or section 306 of the IPC takes place; in a case of an unnatural death inviting Section 304-B of the IPC (read with the presumption under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act, 1872) or section 306 of the IPC (read with the presumption under Section 113-A of the Evidence Act, 1872) as long as there is evidence of poisoning, identification of the poison may not be absolutely necessary." 	Precedent
In Chhotan Sao & Another v. State of Bihar, 2013 (15) SCALE 338 2013 Indlaw SC 851 this Court was dealing with a case involving Sections 304-B and 498A of the IPC. 	Precedent
The allegations were that the deceased was murdered by poisoning her. 	Precedent
The viscera report was not on record. 	Precedent
There was no other evidence on record to establish that the deceased was poisoned. 	Precedent
This Court distinguished the case before it from the facts of Bhupendra and while acquitting the accused of the charge under Section 304-B of the IPC made the following pertinent observations: 	Precedent
Before parting with the appeal, we wish to place on record our anguish regarding the inadequacy of investigation, the failure to discharge the responsibility on the part of the public prosecutor and the Magistrate who took cognizance of the offence under Section 304-B. The Investigating Officer who submitted the charge sheet ought not to have done it without securing the viscera report from the forensic lab and placing it before the Court. 	Precedent
Having regard to the nature of the crime, it is a very vital document more particularly in the absence of any direct evidence regarding the consumption of poison by the deceased Babita Devi. 	Precedent
Equally the public prosecutor failed in his responsibility to guide the investigating officer in that regard. 	Precedent
Coming to the magistrate who committed the matter to the Sessions Court, he failed to apply his mind and mechanically committed the matter for trial. 	Precedent
Public prosecutors and judicial officers owe a greater responsibility to ensure compliance with law in a criminal case. 	Precedent
Any lapse on their part such as the one which occurred in the instant case is bound to jeopardize the prosecution case resulting in avoidable acquittals. 	Precedent
Inefficiency and callousness on their part is bound to shake the faith of the society in the system of administration of criminal justice in this country which, in our opinion, has reached considerably lower level than desirable." 	Precedent
We must note that this is the third case which this Court has noticed in a short span of two months where, in a case of suspected poisoning, viscera report is not brought on record. 	Ratio of the decision
We express our extreme displeasure about the way in which such serious cases are dealt with. 	Ratio of the decision
We wonder whether these lapses are the result of inadvertence or they are a calculated move to frustrate the prosecution. 	Ratio of the decision
Though the FSL report is not mandatory in all cases, in cases where poisoning is suspected, it would be advisable and in the interest of justice to ensure that the viscera is sent to the FSL and the FSL report is obtained. 	Ratio of the decision
This is because not in all cases there is adequate strong other evidence on record to prove that the deceased was administered poison by the accused. 	Ratio of the decision
In a criminal trial the Investigating Officer, the Prosecutor and the Court play a very important role. 	Ratio of the decision
The court's prime duty is to find out the truth. 	Ratio of the decision
The Investigating Officer, the Prosecutor and the Courts must work in sync and ensure that the guilty are punished by bringing on record adequate credible legal evidence. 	Ratio of the decision
If the Investigating Officer stumbles, the Prosecutor must pull him up and take necessary steps to rectify the lacunae. 	Ratio of the decision
The Criminal Court must be alert, it must oversee their actions and, in case, it suspects foul play, it must use its vast powers and frustrate any attempt to set at naught a genuine prosecution. 	Ratio of the decision
Perhaps, the instant case would have been further strengthened had the viscera been sent to the FSL and the FSL report was on record. 	Ratio of the decision
These scientific tests are of vital importance to a criminal case, particularly when the witnesses are increasingly showing a tendency to turn hostile. 	Ratio of the decision
In the instant case all those witnesses who spoke about poisoning turned hostile. 	Ratio of the decision
Had the viscera report been on record and the case of poisoning was true, the prosecution would have been on still firmer grounds. 	Ratio of the decision
Having noticed that, in several cases where poisoning is suspected, the prosecuting agencies are not taking steps to obtain viscera report, we feel it necessary to issue certain directions in that behalf. 	Ratio of the decision
We direct that in cases where poisoning is suspected, immediately after the post- mortem, the viscera should be sent to the FSL. 	Ruling by Present Court
The prosecuting agencies should ensure that the viscera is, in fact, sent to the FSL for examination and the FSL should ensure that the viscera is examined immediately and report is sent to the investigating agencies/courts post haste. 	Ruling by Present Court
If the viscera report is not received, the concerned court must ask for explanation and must summon the concerned officer of the FSL to give an explanation as to why the viscera report is not forwarded to the investigating agency/court. 	Ruling by Present Court
The criminal court must ensure that it is brought on record. 	Ruling by Present Court
We have examined the merits of the case and held that the appeal deserves to be dismissed. 	Ruling by Present Court
In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed. 	Ruling by Present Court
A copy of this order be sent to the Registrar Generals of all the High Courts with a direction to circulate the same to all subordinate Criminal Courts; to the Director of Prosecution, to the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, to the Secretary, Home Department and to the Director, Forensic Science Laboratory within the jurisdiction of the respective High Courts. 	Ruling by Present Court
Appeal dismissed 	Ruling by Present Court
